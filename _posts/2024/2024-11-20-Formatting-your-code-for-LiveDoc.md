## How to format your code for LiveDoc

1. Your repository should be hosted in GitHub.
2. We need a personal access token to access the repository, with read-only privileges.
3. Update the README.md to add section markers that help to extract the relevant text blocks

Example:

```markdown
<!-- Section: Overview -->
## Overview
Project 'Hello World' is a web-based application... 

<!-- Section: Configuration -->
## Configuration
Clone the repository...

<!-- Section: Installation -->
## Installation
Install the npm packages...
