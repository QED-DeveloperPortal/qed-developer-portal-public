Our Developer Portal is designed to facilitate collaboration and information sharing within our community. However, it’s essential to note that the portal supports only up to the SENSITIVE classification level. PROTECTED information, which includes highly sensitive data, is not permitted on the portal.

Here’s a breakdown of the classifications we support:

* **OFFICIAL**:
The Developer Portal is a departmental initiative, classified as an OFFICIAL source for information and collaboration. It offers a wide range of content, including recommendations, best practices, trend alerts, opinions, tips, and ideas, all shared in the spirit of collaboration.

* **OFFICIAL Standards:**
The ‘Standards’ tag is used to highlight departmental standards, policies, and guidelines. Only department staff can create OFFICIAL posts with this tag. However, these posts are typically accessible to everyone, including guests, ensuring critical information is widely available.

* **SENSITIVE:**
This classification applies to information with a medium level of sensitivity, accessible only to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis. SENSITIVE posts on the portal are restricted to departmental staff, helping protect information that could cause limited harm to individuals or the department if improperly disclosed.
