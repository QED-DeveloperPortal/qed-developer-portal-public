# Overview
 
As of the Microsoft Build 2024 developer conference, Azure AI Studio has transitioned from preview to general availability. This cloud-based platform serves as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for developing and deploying generative AI applications. It empowers developers to customize and configure generative AI applications, offering a blend of visual and code-first tooling along with pre-built templates and access to a vast model catalog.
 
## Key takeaways
 
- Azure AI Studio is a cloud-based platform for developing and deploying generative AI applications, providing a pro-code environment with security, privacy, and compliance measures.
- The platform includes a model catalog with over 1,600 models from providers like Meta, Mistral, Microsoft, and OpenAI, featuring the addition of new small language models in Microsoft's Phi3 family and the latest GPT-4o model from OpenAI.
- It offers model benchmarks, a prompt catalog for prompt engineering, and a playground for experimentation.
- Azure AI Studio also integrates Azure AI Search for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) use cases, provides fine-tuning options, supports agent-based orchestration, and offers tracing and debugging features.
- Evaluation processes, both manual and automated, are detailed to ensure the accuracy, quality, and safety of generated outputs, addressing the need for high-quality adversarial test data.
