## Welcome i-Educate attendees to the Developer Portal

We are thrilled to welcome you to the Queensland Department of Education Developer Portal, your gateway to cutting-edge development tools and resources. As we debut our Developer Portal at the i-Educate conference, we invite you to explore, engage, and contribute to this innovative platform as an early bird innovator.

### Our vision

The Developer Portal is designed to be the single source of truth for development standards, policies, guidelines, and recommendations. By bringing together key stakeholders and industry leaders, we aim to foster a collaborative environment where knowledge and best practices are shared, driving excellence and innovation.

### Why your involvement matters

Your expertise and feedback are vital in shaping the future of our development community. As an early bird innovator, you have a unique opportunity to influence and enhance the platform before its public release. By contributing your insights and experiences, you help us build a robust platform that benefits everyone involved, from seasoned developers to newcomers. The Developer Portal is part of the department's ongoing strategy and commitment to collaborate with our community in delivering safe, secure, and quality education services in Queensland.

### Tools and features

Discover the powerful tools and features available on the Developer Portal:

**Centralised documentation**: Access a continually expanding and evolving repository of comprehensive standards, policies, and guidelines all in one place. *Why not try out our search page, or click on a tag of interest to discover more.*

**Collaborative environment**: Share your ideas, post feedback, and contribute to our growing knowledge base. All submissions are reviewed and moderated by subject matter experts, ensuring your input plays a crucial role in shaping future feature decisions. *We invite signed-in members to leave feedback on any post and article.*

**Integration capabilities**: Explore what the Departmentâ€™s production tools can offer. Use our sandboxed versions to get ready for future production use. Note: Production tools aren't directly available here. *Search for 'Data Hub' to discover more about our enterprise integration solutions.*

**Application Catalogue APIs**: Consume simulated API operations via an Application Key created upon sign-up. These APIs simulate a product suite of operations available in our production environment, allowing developers to prepare for production versions. Use the Developer Portal sandbox to trial and experiment with completely safe, simulated data. *Follow the '[APIs](https://developer.qed.qld.gov.au/apis/)' main menu link for more.*
