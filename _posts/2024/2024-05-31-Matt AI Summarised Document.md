# Executive Summary

This document discusses the impressive performance of the Swans in the first half of 2024 AFL season, and the strategies contributing to their success. Here are the key points:

1. The 2024 AFL season has shown unpredictability, with 18% of all games finishing with a margin of less than a goal — the highest proportion since 1950. Amid this chaos, the Swans emerged as frontrunners with a 5-0 record against top-eight sides.
2. The Swans have leveraged evolving strategies in the game. Much focus is on post-clearance contested possessions and the trend of front-half teams. The Swans excel at turning back-half intercepts into scores, and their transition from defence to offence is strategic rather than rapid.
3. Key players such as Nick Blakey have significantly contributed to the success of the Swans with his strong defensive responsibilities and counter-attack strategies. A collective approach towards intercepting, initiating spoils, and effective pressure application have also been instrumental.
4. Despite challenges, their defence style avoids 1v1 situations and leverages speed and flexibility, allowing for aggressive transition without compromising defensive integrity.
5. The team’s ability to adjust strategies on the fly has helped them dominate in second halves of games, demonstrating excellent problem-solving skills.
6. Though early-season success doesn't guarantee finals success, the strategies implemented by the Swans have a sustainable feel. Continuous adaptation will be essential in maintaining their winning streak amid evolving league competition.
