## Pop quiz, hotshot! 

Where is this statement about open source software (OSS) from? 
<br>

>**"The popularity and adoption of OSS products cant (sic) be ignored."**

<br>

1. A 2016 United States Government federal policy that mandates at least 20% of custom source code developed by USA federal agencies must be released as OSS. [1]
<br>
1. A 2018 post on gartner.com about the hype cycle of OSS which asserts that IT leaders must understand and embrace OSS. [2]
<br>
1. A 2020 Queensland Government Enterprise Architecture guideline on OSS. [3]
<br>
1. A 2022 service standard published as part of the UK Government service manual. [4]
<br>

It could plausibly be any of the above because they all provide information in support of OSS, but I took the statement directly from the current QGEA guideline. Given the dates on the options above, we know OSS isn’t *new* but does that mean it's a good idea? Is it really something that government agencies can or should adopt? 

The short answer is, yes! The QGEA guideline itself says, “The Queensland Government endorses the use of appropriately licensed OSS products… and the release of open source software...”. 

Open source helps to:
* reduce costs
* avoid lock-in
* stop duplication
* increase transparency
* add benefits, from improvements by other developers.

To find out more, including what risks to consider and guidance about the release of OSS, visit the [QGEA open source software guideline](https://www.forgov.qld.gov.au/information-and-communication-technology/qgea-policies-standards-and-guidelines/open-source-software-guideline).
