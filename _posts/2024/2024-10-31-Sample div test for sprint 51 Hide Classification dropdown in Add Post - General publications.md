Summary
The legacy classification drop-down is effectively replaced by the public/sesnitive declation option as shown to INTERNAL users. Terms like 'unofficial and official' are removed. The whole site is essentially 'official'
The post UI clearly asks INTERNAL users if their post contains SENSITIVE information or not. If so, the post is saved to the private repo
This applies to NEW posts only. Existing posts cannot change their public/sensitive state (for now). This may mean we need to disable/lock the dropdown while editing. This may be revisited in the future.
