There are two types of tags in the DevPortal site.

<span style="color: #f13030">Pre-defined tags</span>

User defined tags

Pre-defined tags

These tags need to be specified in the tags.yml file. For example, a tag named ‘accessibility’ has been defined in this yml file shown as below.

```
  accessibility:
    name: Accessibility
    css-class: tag-red 
```

There needs to be a corresponding md file in the \_tag folder.

***

layout: tagtag: accesssiblitypermalink: "tag/accessibility"
