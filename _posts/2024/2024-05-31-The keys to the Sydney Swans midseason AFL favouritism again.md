## Overview
The landscape of the 2024 AFL season at the midway mark is marked by unpredictability, with many teams closely contested and only a few showing signs of clear dominance. The Sydney Swans have emerged as contenders for the top spot, showcasing a unique game style and competent defences, suggestive of sustainable success.

## Key takeaways
- 18% of games have finished with a margin of less than a goal, the highest proportion since 1950.
- The Sydney Swans have surged ahead with a 5-0 record against current top-eight sides.
- Game strategies in 2024 focus on post-clearance contested possessions, aiming to be a "front-half team" to stop opponents' transitions and generate repeat inside-50s.
- The Swans' strength lies in their effective scoring from deep and scoring from back-half intercepts, challenging opponents with a mix of fast and slow rebounds.
- The team's defensive approach avoids dramatic intercept marks but focuses on ground level turnovers and effective defensive rebound.
- Sydney has excelled at both scoring from long-range forays and stopping opposition scores from their own defensive rebounds, showcasing a new spin on John Longmire's traditionally defence-first Swans outlook.
- A plethora of fast, flexible players and problem-solving abilities position the Swans for sustained success, but challenges around individual defense and opposing strategies may lie ahead.
