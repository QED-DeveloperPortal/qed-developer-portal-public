## Regulating for Quality (R4Q) Framework

The "Regulating for Quality" (R4Q) framework is a key component in ensuring the quality and compliance of early childhood education and care (ECEC) services in Queensland. Managed by the Department of Education, this framework focuses on several main areas:

### Types of Services Regulated

- Family day care
- Kindergarten
- Long day care
- Outside school hours care

The framework applies to services funded by the Queensland Government, occasional care services, and those linked to the Disability Services Act 2006 (Qld).

### Risk-Based Approach

The department prioritizes monitoring and enforcement activities based on the risk level associated with each service. Key focuses include:
- Ensuring the safety, health, and well-being of children
- Improving educational outcomes
- Promoting continuous improvement in quality

Services posing higher risks receive more attention and frequent checks, while compliant services have less contact from the department.

### Assessment and Rating

Services are assessed and rated based on compliance with the National Quality Standard (NQS) and the Education and Care Services National Law. This process includes:
- Collection of evidence through observations and documentation
- Sharing results with service providers
- Providing opportunities for feedback or requests for reviews

### Compliance Monitoring

The department conducts both announced and unannounced visits to services to monitor compliance. These visits include:
- Checking policies
- Verifying staff qualifications
- Observing practices

Any breaches found are addressed immediately, and high-risk non-compliance can lead to enforcement actions.

### Decision on Applications

When determining applications for service approval, the department considers various factors such as:
- Management capability
- Financial circumstances
- Compliance history
- Suitability of premises

Decisions ensure that all risks are adequately addressed.
