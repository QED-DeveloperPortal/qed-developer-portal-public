Information security classification is crucial for ensuring the secure information handling, storage, and sharing. In the Department of Education, every piece of information is evaluated for sensitivity and classified accordingly. This classification guides us in managing information and protecting it from unauthorised use, modification, disclosure, or loss. Proper classification not only safeguards the integrity of our information but also ensures we comply with the relevant legislation.

### Information on the Developer Portal

Our Developer Portal is designed to facilitate collaboration and information sharing within our community. It offers a wide range of content, including recommendations, best practices, trend alerts, opinions, tips, and ideas, all shared in the spirit of collaboration.

We also post relevant departmental standards, policies, and guidelines so critical information is accessible. We tag these posts with the 'Standards' tag so you can find them easily. 

There is also some information on the portal that we publish for an audience of internal developers and other departmental staff. We keep this information in a separate repository so it doesn't affect the experience for our external users.

### Moderation and specialist review

All submissions to the Developer Portal are strictly moderated, to ensure they meet our quality and privacy standards. Additionally, posts containing specialist information, such as cyber security, information security, and enterprise architecture, may be subject to further review by departmental subject matter experts before being published. This ensures that all content is accurate, relevant, and handled appropriately.
