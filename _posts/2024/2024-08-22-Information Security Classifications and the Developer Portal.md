Information security classification is crucial for ensuring the secure handling, storage, and sharing of information. Within the Department of Education Queensland, every piece of information is evaluated for sensitivity and classified accordingly. This classification helps us understand how to manage the information, protecting it from unauthorised use, modification, disclosure, or loss. Proper classification not only safeguards the integrity of our data but also ensures compliance with state and federal legislation.

### Supported classifications on the Developer Portal

Our Developer Portal is designed to facilitate collaboration and information sharing within our community. However, it's essential to note that the Portal supports only up to the **SENSITIVE** classification level. **PROTECTED** information, which includes highly sensitive data that could cause significant harm if disclosed, is not permitted on the Portal.

Here's a breakdown of the classifications supported on the Developer Portal:

- **UNOFFICIAL**:  
This classification is available for all personal, community, and conversational posts. UNOFFICIAL posts can be created by portal members and viewed by anyone, including guests to the site. Itâ€™s ideal for sharing ideas, opinions, experiences and recommendations that are not necessarily official departmental standards or policies.

- **OFFICIAL**:  
This classification is used for departmental standards, policies, guidelines and similar documents. Only department staff can create OFFICIAL posts. These posts are accessible to everyone, including guests, ensuring that critical information is widely available.

- **SENSITIVE**:  
  This classification applies to information with a medium level of sensitivity, accessible only to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis. On the Developer Portal, SENSITIVE posts can only be viewed by departmental staff. This classification helps protect information that, if improperly released, could cause limited harm to the department or individuals.

### Moderation and specialist review

All submissions to the Developer Portal, regardless of classification, will undergo our strict moderation process to ensure they meet our standards. Additionally, posts containing specialist information, such as cyber security, information security, and enterprise architecture, may be subject to further review by departmental subject matter experts before being published on the site. This ensures that all content is accurate, relevant, and appropriately handled according to its classification.

### Key points to remember
- **UNOFFICIAL** content is accessible to all and is ideal for community-driven discussions.
- **OFFICIAL** content is restricted to departmental standards and is accessible to all users.
- **SENSITIVE** content is restricted to department staff only and must be handled with additional care.
- **PROTECTED** content is not supported on the Developer Portal.

By adhering to these classifications and processes, we can ensure that all information shared on the Developer Portal is appropriate for its intended audience and securely managed.
