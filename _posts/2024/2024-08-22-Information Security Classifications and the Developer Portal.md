Information security classification is crucial for ensuring the secure information handling, storage, and sharing. Within the Department of Education, every piece of information is evaluated for sensitivity and classified accordingly. This classification guides us in managing information and protecting it from unauthorised use, modification, disclosure, or loss. Proper classification not only safeguards the integrity of our information but also ensures we comply with state and federal legislation.

### Supported classifications on the Developer Portal

Our Developer Portal is designed to facilitate collaboration and information sharing within our community. However, it's essential to note that the portal supports only up to the **SENSITIVE** classification level. **PROTECTED** information, which includes highly sensitive data, is not permitted on the portal.

Here's a breakdown of the classifications we support:

- **UNOFFICIAL**:  
Although it's not a formal departmental classification, we have added UNOFFICIAL to cover all personal, community, and conversational posts. UNOFFICIAL posts can be created by portal members and viewed by anyone, including guests to the site. Itâ€™s ideal for sharing ideas, opinions, experiences and recommendations that are not necessarily official departmental standards or policies.

- **OFFICIAL**:  
We use this classification for departmental standards, policies, guidelines and similar documents. Only department staff can create OFFICIAL posts. These posts are accessible to everyone, including guests, ensuring that critical information is widely available.

- **SENSITIVE**:  
 This classification applies to information with a medium level of sensitivity, accessible only to authorised personnel on a need-to-know basis. On the portal, SENSITIVE posts can only be viewed by departmental staff. This classification helps protect information that, if improperly released, could cause limited harm to individuals or the department.

### Moderation and specialist review

All submissions to the Developer Portal, regardless of classification, will be strictly moderated, to ensure they meet our standards. Additionally, posts containing specialist information, such as cyber security, information security, and enterprise architecture, may be subject to further review by departmental subject matter experts before being published. This ensures that all content is accurate, relevant, and appropriately handled according to its classification.

### Key points to remember
- **UNOFFICIAL** content is accessible to all and is ideal for community-driven discussions.
- **OFFICIAL** content is restricted to departmental standards and is accessible to all users.
- **SENSITIVE** content is restricted to departmental staff only and must be handled with additional care.
- **PROTECTED** content is not supported on the Developer Portal.

By adhering to these classifications and processes, we can ensure that all information shared here is appropriate for its intended audience and securely managed.
