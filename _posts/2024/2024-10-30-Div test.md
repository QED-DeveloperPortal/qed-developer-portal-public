Feature gaps in the existing implementation
The existing implementation of the LiveDoc tool still has some features that have yet to be implemented.

Trigger LiveDoc: Initiate a scan directly from the Admin site on the QED Developer Portal.

Set schedules: Define custom schedules for scanning based on the projectâ€™s requirements. Scheduling LiveDoc is an important part of the document generation as it ensures the projects documentation is always current and reflection of the existing state of the project.

View Reports: Access a history of generated markdown documents, with insights into changes made over time.

Manage API keys: Generate and manage API keys to maintain secure access. Whilst this functionality already exists in the Admin site on the QED Developer Portal, the LiveDoc Apis are secured by a different mechanism.
