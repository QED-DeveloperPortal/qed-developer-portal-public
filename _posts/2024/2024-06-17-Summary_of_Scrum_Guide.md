# The Scrum Guide: Summary
 
The Scrum Guide, last revised in November 2020 by Schwaber and Sutherland, defines Scrum as a lightweight framework for generating value through adaptive solutions for complex problems. It focuses on empiricism and lean thinking and is represented by its principles, set of events, artifacts, and roles.
 
## Key takeaways
 
- **Scrum Definition:** Scrum is purposefully incomplete, enabling collective intelligence to influence its direction.
- **Scrum Theory:** Founded on empiricism and lean thinking, Scrum uses iterative, incremental approaches to control risk and optimize predictability.
- **Scrum Values:** Living values such as commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage is fundamental to successful Scrum implementation.
- **Scrum Team:** Comprising the Scrum Master, Product Owner, and Developers, the team is cross-functional, self-managing, and focused on a shared objective.
- **Scrum Events:** The Sprint, Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective make up the events providing opportunities for inspection and adaptation.
- **Scrum Artifacts:** Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and Increment aim for transparency and maximizing the value of work undertaken.

## Additional key points

- Scrum is designed to offer a free, definitive framework that stands alone and operates best when used in its entirety.
- The Scrum Team is responsible for its own management and achieving objectives.
- The Scrum Guide acknowledges historical contributions and encourages reading or consideration of an attribution share-alike license as per Creative Commons.
