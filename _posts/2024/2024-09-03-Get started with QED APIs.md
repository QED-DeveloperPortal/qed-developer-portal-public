The [DevPortal Starter Kit](https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/DevPortal-Starter-Kit) contains examples of how QED APIs can be called.

Currently there are GET and POST examples. 

PUT and DELETE examples will be added shortly.

Simply download the C# repo and uncomment the relevant code in the Program.cs file before you run it.
