### Overview

Mockaco is a modified open source repo that enables the public provisioning of mock versions of the Queensland Education Department APIs.


### Source code

The original repo can be found at [https://github.com/natenho/Mockaco](https://github.com/natenho/Mockaco).
 
The modified copy of this repo can be found at [https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/Mockaco](https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/Mockaco).


### Deployment

It is deployed in Azure as a Web App named dp-mockaco.

The mock QED APIs that this tool manages are visually displayed to end users via a Microsoft Blazor interface whose code is at [https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/mockportal](https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/mockportal).

Updates to the MockPortal repo are published to Azure inside the APIs folder of the qed-developer-portal repo via a Github Action.

### External access

The mocked QED APIs can also be called as APIs via the base URL [https://dp-mockaco.azurewebsites.net](https://dp-mockaco.azurewebsites.net).

End users are required to pass an X-Api-Key value as part of the HTTP request header. End users can request an X-Api-Key via the MockPortal part of Developer Portal website. This value is stored in Cosmos DB for each user.
