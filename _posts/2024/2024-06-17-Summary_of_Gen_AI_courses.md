# Overview
    The document provides a comprehensive guide on learning and building projects using Large Language Models (LLMs) like GenAI. It covers the process of building a chatbot, retrieval augmented generation for question answering over documents, image generation, fine-tuning LLMs, and creating research agents. 
    
    ## Key takeaways
    - **Build your own Chatbot:**
      - Training a chatbot involves two phases: pre-training and fine-tuning for conversational tasks.
      - Practical implementation of chatbot projects is covered in various short courses focusing on prompt engineering, moderation, and systems integration.
    - **Retrieval Augmented Generation: Question Answering Over Documents:**
      - The four key steps in retrieval augmented generation process are extract, chunking, embedding, and retrieval.
      - Courses and frameworks like Langchain and LlmaIndex offer comprehensive overviews of the RAG process.
    - **Generating Images:**
      - A course “How Diffusion Models Work” is recommended to learn about building and training diffusion models for image generation.
    - **Fine-tune your LLM:**
      - Different courses cover the process of fine-tuning LLMs, including model selection, training and deployment.
    - **Research Agent:**
      - Research Agent development involves mastering LLM function capabilities and use of agentic frameworks like AutoGen and CrewAI.
      - Several courses are available for developing tools and designing research agents using specialized agentic frameworks.
    
    ## Additional key points
    - Langchain can be used for integrating chatbot interfaces, RAG processing, and building pipelines with a GUI.
    - LlamaIndex framework not only provides a good overview but also discusses RAG application evaluation techniques.
    - Various courses cover extraction, embedding, vector databases, and advanced retrieval techniques for RAG process.
    - Several open-source model families like HuggingFace and Llama-2 offer resources for fine-tuning LLMs.
    - Mastery of function calling through courses like “Functions tools and agents with Langchain” and “NexusFlow function calling” is essential for building a research agent.
