### Deployment

It is deployed in Azure as a Web App named dp-mockaco.

The mock QED APIs that this tool manages are visually displayed to end users via a Microsoft Blazor interface whose code is at [https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/mockportal](https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/mockportal).

Updates to the MockPortal repo are published to Azure inside the apis folder of the qed-developer-portal repo via a Github Action.
