Mockaco is an open source repo that we adapted to enable us to provide a publicly available mocks of the QED APIs.

The original repo can be found at https://github.com/natenho/Mockaco
 
We put a copy of this repo at https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/Mockaco/ and then modified it to suit our needs.

We expose this tool visually to the end users via a Microsoft Blazor interface that we have at https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/mockportal

The MockPortal is published to Azure inside the apis folder of the qed-developer-portal repo via a Github Action.
