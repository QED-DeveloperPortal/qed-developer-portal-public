Mockaco is a modified open source repo that enables the public provisioning of mock versions of the Queensland Education Department APIs.

The original repo can be found at https://github.com/natenho/Mockaco.
 
The modified copy of this repo can be found at https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/Mockaco.

It is deployed in Azure as a Web App named dp-mockaco.

The mock QED APIs that this tool manages are visually displayed to end users via a Microsoft Blazor interface whose code is at https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/mockportal.

Updates to the MockPortal repo are published to Azure inside the apis folder of the qed-developer-portal repo via a Github Action.

The mocked QED APIs can also be called as APIs via the base URI https://dp-mockaco.azurewebsites.net.
