## How to travel using your go card

1. **Register your card and protect your travel balance**

    - Registering your go card gives you peace of mind. If your go card is lost or stolen, your travel balance will be protected as soon as you advise Translink by calling 13 12 30. You can also block your card via your online account.
    - You can arrange a new go card and transfer your deposit and travel balance from the old card to your new card.
2. **Top up your go card**

    - Make sure you always have enough money to travel by topping up your go card regularly. You can store up to $250 on your go card. If you don't use your go card for five years you'll no longer be able to use the card to travel. You can apply for a refund for any unused credit on your card.

    Top up your go card balance at:

    - Fare machines
    - go card locations
    - Phone
    - Online

    Set up auto top up: Auto top-up means you will always have enough balance on your go card to get you to your destination. When your travel balance falls below $5 it triggers a top up (of your chosen amount) from your credit or debit card. To activate auto top-up you will need to register your go card.
3. **Tap on and tap off**

    - Always remember to tap your go card flat onto the card reader at the beginning and end of your journey. Your go card will automatically calculate the correct fare.

    **Buses**

    - Card readers are located at the front and rear doors on buses.

    **Trains and trams**

    - Card readers are located on station platforms and major stations have card readers attached to fare gates.

    **Ferries**

    - On the ferry you can tap on and tap off at any of the card readers located onboard.
4. **Managing your go card**

    - Make your go card work for you by managing your card online. To create an online account, you will need to register your go card.

## Common card reader messages

- Red light or a red cross: please try again or try tapping another card reader.
- Please tap again message: tap your card to the reader flat against the target.
- Already tapped message: your card has been read, just continue on your journey.
- Seek assistance message: seek help from a staff member or call 13 12 30 to report the problem.

## Cancelling your journey
 
If you've already tapped on but no longer need to travel, wait 10 seconds and then tap your card again to the card reader to cancel your journey. You have up to 20 minutes to cancel your journey or you will be charged a fixed amount.
 
## Transferring between services
 
When transferring between services, your go card will calculate one overall fare for your whole journey. Simply tap on and tap off for each trip of the journey and make sure to:

- Continue your journey within 60 minutes from within the same or adjoining zones.
- Transfer up to three times in a journey, starting your final transfer within three and a half hours of your initial tap on.

## go card fares
 
Your go card calculates how many zones you travel during each journey, then deducts the correct fare from your travel balance.
 
## Fixed amount
 
Failure to tap on or tap off correctly will result in a fixed amount being deducted from your travel balance. Your go card will only calculate the correct fare for your journey when you tap on and tap off. Failing to do this means your go card will not know when your journey began or ended.
 
Fixed amounts are as follows:

- Adult: Bus/ferry/tram $5, Train $10, SMBI ferry $10
- Senior: Bus/ferry/tram $2.50, Train $5, SMBI ferry $5
- Concession: Bus/ferry/tram $5, Train $10, SMBI ferry $10
- Child: Bus/ferry/tram $5, Train $10, SMBI ferry $10

## Managing your go card

- Set up auto top-up so you’ll always have enough credit to travel.
- Top up your go card using your debit or credit card.
- Check your travel balance, view up to six months transaction history and print GST information for taxation purposes.
- Transfer the balance of your card to another registered go card.
- View your travel history, including your last 10 transactions at fare machines and selected go card locations.
- Report an incorrect fare and request a balance adjustment.
- Check your go card expiry date.
- Change your opt-in preferences to include market research, go card notifications, product and service updates and special offers.

## Balance adjustments
 
A go card balance adjustment is a credit or debit made to your travel credit because the correct amount was not charged due to a confirmed system related issue. Fixed amounts applied due to customer error are non-refundable.
 
## Card expiry
 
When does my go card expire?

- Adult and senior cards are programmed to expire 10 years from the date of issue.
- Child go cards expire on the child’s 15th birthday.
- Concession go cards are programmed to expire 14 days from the date of issue unless proof of concession is provided at selected retailers.

## My go card has already expired
 
An expired go card is not valid for travel. However, you have up to 255 days to change the expiry date. After the 255 day grace period, the card cannot be reactivated and a new go card will need to be purchased.
 
## Damaged go cards
 
If you can’t tap on or tap off and you can see that other people can, your card may be faulty or damaged. Call Translink immediately on 13 12 30 to report it.
