## The benefits of using go card
 
Travelling with go card on the Translink network:

- Saves you money
- Makes travel easy
- Convenience

## Top travel tips

- Remember to always tap on AND tap off or you will be charged a fixed amount which will be displayed the next time you tap on.
- Your go card is for your use only and is not transferable for use by anyone else.

## go card fees and start-up costs
 
Before you start using your go card, you will need to add value to your card and pay a refundable deposit. This deposit is like a safety net which allows you to finish your journey even if you have insufficient funds on the card (as long as your balance is positive at the start of your journey).
 
|            | Adult | Senior | Concession | Child | |------------|-------|--------|------------|-------| | Refundable deposit | $10 | $5 | - | - | | Minimum starting balance | $5 | $5 | $5 | $5 | | Card issuance fee\* | $5\* | $5\* | $5\* | $5\* |
 
\*This fee is currently waived
 
## How to travel using your go card

1. **Register your card and protect your travel balance**

    - Registering your go card gives you peace of mind. If your go card is lost or stolen, your travel balance will be protected as soon as you advise Translink by calling 13 12 30. You can also block your card via your online account.
    - You can arrange a new go card and transfer your deposit and travel balance from the old card to your new card.
2. **Top up your go card**

    - Make sure you always have enough money to travel by topping up your go card regularly. You can store up to $250 on your go card. If you don't use your go card for five years you'll no longer be able to use the card to travel. You can apply for a refund for any unused credit on your card.

    Top up your go card balance at:

    - Fare machines
    - go card locations
    - Phone
    - Online

    Set up auto top up: Auto top-up means you will always have enough balance on your go card to get you to your destination. When your travel balance falls below $5 it triggers a top up (of your chosen amount) from your credit or debit card. To activate auto top-up you will need to register your go card.
3. **Tap on and tap off**

    - Always remember to tap your go card flat onto the card reader at the beginning and end of your journey. Your go card will automatically calculate the correct fare.

    **Buses**

    - Card readers are located at the front and rear doors on buses.

    **Trains and trams**

    - Card readers are located on station platforms and major stations have card readers attached to fare gates.

    **Ferries**

    - On the ferry you can tap on and tap off at any of the card readers located onboard.

    **Troubleshooting**

    - If your tap on or tap off is unsuccessful the go card reader will display a red light. Please try again. If the card reader displays another red light please try another card reader. If the card reader is displaying an error message or you are unable to tap on or tap off successfully please call Translink on 13 12 30.
4. **Managing your go card**

    - Make your go card work for you by managing your card online. To create an online account, you will need to register your go card.
