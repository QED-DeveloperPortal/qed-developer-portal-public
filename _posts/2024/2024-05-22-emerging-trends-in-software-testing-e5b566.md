### 4. Crowdtesting
Crowdtesting is a method that involves a large group of testers who are not part of the company's internal QA team. These testers have unique skills and access to various devices. Organisations can engage with these testers through crowdsourcing platforms where they can submit their software or applications for testing. This process helps companies to complete their test cycles quickly. The significant benefits of using crowdtesting include:

Complementing in-house testing, crowdtesting offers effective user acceptance testing, providing real-world usage insights. As more organisations adopt this strategy, the global market for crowdtesting is expected to expand.

### 5. Evolution of test automation: low-code and no-code approach
The trend of testing earlier in the development process, or 'shift-left', is gaining popularity as testing is now being conducted in parallel with development. Low-code and no-code technologies, becoming increasingly popular in software development, are now set to revolutionise the testing domain.

**Scriptless test automation** enables testing without extensive coding. This evolution transforms a field traditionally reserved for developers, allowing non-technical stakeholders to engage in testing. They can now plan, execute, and analyse tests without the need for complex coding. This approach saves developer hours and broadens productivity across the organisation by granting non-technical team members access to customised software solutions.

### 6. Enhanced focus on security testing and DevSecOps

Given the surge in cybersecurity threats and data breach incidents recently making headlines, it's unsurprising that security testing and the emerging field of DevSecOps are poised to dominate the tech landscape.

### 9. API test automation
The rise of microservices architectures has significantly increased the number of application programming interfaces (APIs), making API-driven development more relevant than ever. However, using APIs comes with the risk of security breaches involving sensitive data. API testing is a more efficient alternative to extensive graphical user interface testing in Agile or DevOps environments, where speed is crucial.

In order to meet the increasing requirements of API testing, it is important to embrace more powerful automation techniques. This includes various types of testing, such as:

* Interoperability
* Smoke testing
* Runtime error detection
* Penetration and security testing 
* Basic unit testing.

Automation is the solution for achieving higher efficiency, enabling more tests to be performed in a shorter time and, ideally, at a lower cost. Moreover, automating the recurring execution of API tests, whether at specified intervals or designated stages in the CI/CD pipeline, is increasingly becoming the standard practice. This approach streamlines the testing process while also ensuring consistency and reliability in API performance across different stages of development.

### 10. Focus on accessibility testing
In the era of web and mobile accessibility regulations, ensuring compliance through accessibility testing has become a critical component of software development.
