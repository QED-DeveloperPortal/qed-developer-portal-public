The document provides in-depth guidance on how to create a high-quality summarisation model, focusing on the crucial stages of split testing, training sets, and model evaluation. During the validation process, it is key that testing is carried out with examples separate from those used for training.

**Key Takeaways**
- It's crucial in verifying the quality of your custom summarisation model to use differing examples for the training and testing stage.
- When split testing:
  - Ensure the test set is of significant *Size* - remember, testing on only a few examples can lead to false validations.
  - Thoroughly check that *No Overlap* has occurred between documents used in testing and training stages.
  -  Carefully look for *Diversity* in testing-- bring in a mixed variety of lengths, topics, styles in documents and if applicable for conversation summarisations, include variations in the number of turns and speakers.
  
- When checking the overall performance of your model, it is advisable not only to use automated evaluation but also a manual checking system.
  - **Automatic evaluation** via the *Rouge* technique helps in quickly judging the quality of necessarily diverse inputs, through a metric system contrasting originally human-made ideal summaries and summaries produced by the trained model in talking. Read the resources mentioned to learn more about Rouge application.
  - The **manual evaluation** plays paramount role in establishing substantial confidence in the model produces quality summarises. Observe:
    - **Fluency**, calling for summaries devoid of technical and capitalisation errors.
    - A structured lunucris layout pointing to coherent and organised summaries.
    - **Coverage**: Pointing to inclusive, detailed well approached in completeness.
    - Maintains **Relevance**( touching only bases gaining cues essence from the source document) altogether avoiding an influx calculated from idle stories
    - Alerts on **Hallucinatory effects**, treating red fiery alarms on wrong or unfounded source origins, to numerous interpretations containing summary pieces.
