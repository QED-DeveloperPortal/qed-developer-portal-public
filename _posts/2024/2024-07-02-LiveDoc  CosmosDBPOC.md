# CosmosDBPOC Repository Summary

## Overview of the Application
The repository "CosmosDBPOC" is a .NET console application designed to demonstrate how to use the Azure Cosmos DB service to store and access data.

## Summary of Repository
- **Repository Name**: CosmosDBPOC
- **Location**: [CosmosDBPOC](https://github.com/mattyboisterous/CosmosDBPOC)
- **Primary Language**: C#
- **Architecture**: The application consists of models, repositories, and a main program to interact with Azure Cosmos DB.
- **Key Features**:
  - Connect to Azure Cosmos DB
  - Perform CRUD operations on application and API request data
  - Demonstrate the use of repositories for data access

## Code Summary
- **Total Files**: 14 files
- **Total Lines of Code**: Approx. 650 lines
- **Main Components**:
  - `Models`: Define the data structure (ApiRequest, ApiRequestSummary, Application)
  - `Repositories`: Handle data operations (ApiRequestRepository, ApplicationRepository)
  - `Program.cs`: Main entry point for the application

## Code Structure
1. **App.config**: Configuration file for the application.
2. **Enumerations.cs**: Contains enumeration definitions.
3. **Models**:
   - `ApiRequest.cs`: Represents an API request.
   - `ApiRequestSummary.cs`: Represents a summary of API requests.
   - `Application.cs`: Represents an application with various properties.
4. **Program.cs**: Main program that initializes repositories, interacts with the database, and handles user input.
5. **Repositories**:
   - `ApiRequestRepository.cs`: Manages API request data.
   - `ApplicationRepository.cs`: Manages application data.
   - `Base/Interfaces/IRepositoryBase.cs`: Interface for base repository functionality.
   - `Base/RepositoryBase.cs`: Base class for repositories.
   - `Interfaces/IApiRequestRepository.cs`: Interface for API request repository.
   - `Interfaces/IApplicationRepository.cs`: Interface for application repository.

## Dependencies and Third-Party Libraries
- **Newtonsoft.Json**: Used for JSON serialization.
- **Microsoft.Azure.Cosmos**: Azure Cosmos DB SDK for interacting with the database.

## Recent Pull Requests
No recent pull requests found.

## Project Contributors
The list of contributors is not directly available from the current repository structure and would require additional queries or access to the repository's contributor's page.

## Special Features of the Project
- **Repository Pattern**: The application uses repository patterns to abstract data access logic.
- **Async Programming**: Utilizes async methods for database operations to ensure non-blocking calls.
- **Configuration Flexibility**: Uses `App.config` for endpoint and key configurations.

## Developer Notes
The README file provides a comprehensive guide to setting up and running the application, including necessary prerequisites and configuration steps.
