- Children aged between 5 and 14 travel free on the weekend with a child go card
- Seniors Card +go, senior go card or green pensioner concession go card holders who use go card for 2 paid journeys in 1 day travel free for the rest of the day
- A further 20% off-peak discount applies between 8.30am - 3.30pm, and after 7pm until 6am on weekdays (includes all day weekends and on state-wide gazetted Queensland public holidays)

Makes travel easy with Translink's network of bus, train, ferry, and tram services, beat the queues and forget the worry of fumbling for change. *go card* automatically calculates your fare when you tap on and tap off.
