The term ‘digital transformation’ tends to be thrown about a lot without much consideration for what it actually is, which is one way myths begin. Here are some common myths about digital transformation: 
 
| Myth | Truth |
| --- | --- |
| Digital transformation is a one-time project. | There is no fixed end point because transformation is an ongoing process. |
| Digital transformation is all about technology. | It’s equally about changing culture, processes and how services are delivered. |
| You need a complete overhaul for digital transformation. | Transformation will look different in every group; just focus on incremental improvements and you’ll be on your way. |
 
The Digital Transformation Agency offers the following definition of digital transformation: 

>Digital transformation is about delivery improvements to policy, process and technology to better meet user needs.

 What it is:
* User-centred.
* Innovation.
* Willingness to change.
* Developing new skills and capabilities across entire organisations.
* Evidence-based.
* Data-driven.
* Enabled by technology.

What it’s not:
* Only digitising paper transactions or processes.
* Restricted to technology teams.
* Siloed skills and single-function teams.
* Focused on outputs.
* Driven by technology.

Transformation begins with building awareness of, and then building capability in, digital tools, practices and mindsets.
