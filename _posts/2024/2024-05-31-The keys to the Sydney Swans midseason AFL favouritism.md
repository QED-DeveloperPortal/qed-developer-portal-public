# Executive Summary

The 2024 AFL season has been marked by the unpredictability of match outcomes and unclear distinctions between contenders and pretenders. In this chaos, the Sydney Swans have emerged as a potential frontrunner, largely due to their strategic approach to the game and their effective ability to turn back-half intercepts into scores.

# Key Takeaways 

- The Swans have demonstrated a strength in scoring from deep, highlighting the team's effectiveness in turning defensive intercepts into offence.
- Key player, Nick Blakey, plays a significant role in both defensive and counter-attack position, performing exceptionally in creating scores with intercepts.
- Unique to the Swans' strategy is their focus on a spoil-first approach, placing less emphasis on intercept marks and instead directing spoils to advantageous areas.
- The Swans have also maintained a solid base, effectively controlling their own turnovers and minimizing the opposition's scoring chances off their own defensive rebounds.
- The Swans' defenders have been efficiently covering turnovers and preventing 1v1 marking contests, keeping the defence robust.
- The ability to make rapid changes during games, especially in the second half, speaks to the Swans' resilience and adaptability.
- Despite their current edge, the Swans will need to continue developing their strategies and adapting to changes, as the AFL season unfolds and competitors work to establish an edge.
