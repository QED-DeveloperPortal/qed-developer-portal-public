- Protect your travel balance by registering your go card.

### Top Travel Tips
- Remember to always tap on AND tap off or you will be charged a fixed amount which will be displayed the next time you tap on.
- Your go card is for your use only and is not transferable for use by anyone else.

### Go Card Fees and Start-Up Costs
Before you start using your go card, you will need to add value to your card and pay a refundable deposit. This deposit is like a safety net which allows you to finish your journey even if you have insufficient funds on the card (as long as your balance is positive at the start of your journey).

|                      | Adult | Senior | Concession | Child |
|----------------------|-------|--------|------------|-------|
| Refundable Deposit   | $10   | $5     | $5         | $5    |
| Minimum Starting Balance | $5 | $5     | $5         | $5    |
| Card Issuance Fee*   | $5    | $5     | $5         | $5    |

*This fee is currently waived.

## How to Travel Using Your Go Card

### 1. Register Your Go Card
Registering your go card gives you peace of mind. If your go card is lost or stolen, your travel balance will be protected as soon as you advise Translink by calling 13 12 30. You can also block your card via your online account.

You can arrange a new go card and transfer your deposit and travel balance from the old card to your new card. If your go card is not registered and is lost or stolen, your balance is not protected.

Extra security: Your secure online account holds your personal information and your go card serial number - your go card holds no personal information. Your account is password protected, be sure to keep this safe along with your go card number to help us quickly assist you if your card is lost, stolen, damaged or faulty.

Find more information on how to register your go card on page 13.

### 2. Top Up Your Go Card
Make sure you always have enough money to travel by topping up your go card regularly. You can store up to $250 on your go card. If you don't use your go card for five years you'll no longer be able to use the card to travel. You can apply for a refund for any unused credit on your card.

Top up your go card balance at:
- Fare machines: Top up at fare machines with cash or debit card by selecting ‘add value’ from the go card menu and follow the instructions. The maximum you can top up is $200.
- Go card locations: Top up at selected retailers, plus attended train stations where you see the ‘top up’ sign. Search online for your closest location at translink.com.au/gocardretailers. Simply present your go card along with your payment.
- Phone: Call 13 12 30 to top up your go card balance. You will need your 16 digit go card number and a valid credit or debit card.
- Online: visit translink.com.au. Once your go card is registered, log into your secure account and top up. The maximum top up amount is $200 for phone or online. In most instances, the money will be available on your go card within an hour. It won’t appear on your travel balance until you tap on at a card reader. If you top up by phone or online and do not use your go card within 60 days your transaction will be reversed and the money will be returned to your credit or debit card.

Set up auto top up: Auto top-up means you will always have enough balance on your go card to get you to your destination. When your travel balance falls below $5 it triggers a top up (of your chosen amount) from your credit or debit card. To activate auto top-up you will need to register your go card.

### 3. Tap On and Tap Off
Always remember to tap your go card flat onto the card reader at the beginning and end of your journey. Your go card will automatically calculate the correct fare. The go card reader will display a green light with one beep for an adult card or an orange light with two beeps for a concession card.

When you tap on: the card reader will show the balance of travel credit stored on your go card.

When you tap off: the card reader will show the fare deducted and your remaining travel balance. When tapping on or off, there is no need to wait for the card reader balance display to clear from the previous passenger. Please note: if you swipe or wave your card in front of the card reader or leave it in your purse or wallet, your transaction may not be successful.

#### Buses
Card readers are located at the front and rear doors on buses.
- At the start of your journey, tap on at the front near the driver or near the rear door of the bus.
- At the end of your journey, tap off either at the front or rear door of the bus.
- Card readers are activated at designated bus stops only – you cannot tap on or tap off at a card reader while the bus is in motion or between stops.

When not at a designated stop, the card reader will display a ‘please wait’ message – if this message appears at your stop, please advise the driver.

#### Trains and Trams
Card readers are located on station platforms and major stations have card readers attached to fare gates.
- At fare gates, tap on as you enter the station or platform to begin your journey and tap off as you exit the station or platform at the end of your journey, even when the gates are open.
- At card readers, tap on as you enter the station or platform to begin your journey and tap off as you exit the station or platform at the end of your journey.

You do not need to tap on or tap off when transferring between Queensland Rail Citytrain services.

#### Ferries
- On the ferry you can tap on and tap off at any of the card readers located onboard – near the ticket seller and where you embark or disembark.
- Card readers are activated at designated ferry stops only – you cannot tap on or tap off at a card reader while the ferry is in motion or between stops.

### Cancelling Your Journey

### Transferring Between Services
You can transfer between services within an hour of tapping off at your previous stop and continue your journey without paying another fare. The services must be of the same type (bus, train, ferry or tram) to be considered a transfer.

### Go Card Fares
The fare you are charged is based on the zones you travel through during your journey. The Translink network is divided into eight zones. Your go card calculates your fare based on the number of zones you travel through. 

### Translink Fares
Fares are calculated based on the number of zones you travel and the time of day you travel. Peak and off-peak rates apply. Discounts apply for children, students, pensioners, seniors, and defense force veterans.

### Fixed Amount
If you forget to tap off, a fixed amount will be deducted the next time you tap on.

### Managing Your Go Card
You can manage your go card online or via the Translink mobile app. Check your balance, view your travel history, top up your card, and update your details easily.

### You’re Set Up, So What Next?
Continue using your go card for all your travel needs across the Translink network. Make sure to keep your card topped up and remember to tap on and off for each journey.

### Balance Adjustments
If you believe your balance has been incorrectly charged, contact Translink customer service for assistance. They can help resolve any discrepancies and adjust your balance if necessary.

### Card Expiry
Go cards expire after five years of inactivity. Ensure you use your card periodically to avoid expiry. If your card does expire, contact Translink to transfer your balance to a new card.

### My Go Card Has Already Expired
If your go card has expired, contact Translink customer service to transfer your remaining balance to a new card. You will need to provide your old card number and other relevant details.
