At the Queensland Department of Education, we firmly believe that accessibility is not just a requirement but a fundamental right. Our commitment to accessibility reflects our dedication to fostering an inclusive environment where every individual, regardless of their abilities, can thrive and contribute to their fullest potential.


## Inclusive education for all

Our mission is to give every child a great start and to engage every student through inclusive learning. This starts with accessible educational environments that cater to the needs of all students, including those with disabilities. We are dedicated to lifting learning outcomes for all Queenslanders by providing supportive and adaptable learning spaces.

## Our strategic vision

Our Accessibility Action Plan aligns with the state and departmental disability plans, reinforcing our commitment to:

* **Visible and accountable commitment:** Our leadership actively promotes accessibility and inclusivity, ensuring that our commitment is clear and measurable.
* **Accessible products, services, and facilities:** We strive to make all aspects of our workplace, from facilities to digital content, accessible to everyone.
* **Awareness and capability building:** We educate and train our staff to understand and value diverse abilities, embedding inclusive practices across our organisation.

## Measuring success
We track our progress through various metrics, including the increase in staff who identify as living with a disability and those with active workplace adjustments. We also measure engagement with training sessions and partnerships with organisations like the Australian Network on Disability.

## A shared responsibility
Creating an accessible and inclusive society is a collective effort. Everyone plays a role in fostering a culture of inclusivity, ensuring that our communities are welcoming and accommodating for all abilities.

## Key actions to enhance accessibility
* **Integrate accessibility early:** Embed accessibility requirements from the design phase.
* **Regular audits:** Conduct regular accessibility audits using appropriate tools.
* **Accessible documentation:** Provide all documentation in accessible formats with text alternatives.
* **Team training:** Train your team on accessibility best practices and standards.
* **User engagement:** Involve users with disabilities in testing and feedback.
* **Accessibility features:** Ensure compatibility with assistive technologies or offer customisation options.
* **Continuous monitoring:** Monitor and address accessibility issues continuously.
* **Inclusive culture:** Promote an inclusive culture that values and advocates for accessibility.

## Join us in our mission
We invite everyone to join us in our mission to support a flexible and diverse community that truly values and respects all abilities. Together, we can create a better, more inclusive future for all Queenslanders.
