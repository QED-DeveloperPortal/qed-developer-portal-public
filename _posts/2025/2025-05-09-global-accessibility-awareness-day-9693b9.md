I discovered this article by Karl Groves called [Digital Accessibility is a Civil Right](https://karlgroves.com/digital-accessibility-is-a-civil-right/) via a post on the [Apolitical website](https://apolitical.co/en) and, although I recommend clicking through to read the whole post, I want to note some of the main points as a nod to Global Accessibility Awareness Day, which is coming up on Thursday 15 May 2025.

Karl’s article is framed as a response to a news article that ostensibly defends businesses and developers (who build inaccessible websites) against lawsuits in the United States. The main thrust of his response is that digital accessibility is not a legal loophole; it’s a civil rights issue to be taken seriously. 

* **Claiming that ‘the law predates the internet’ isn’t a valid excuse**
Although Karl’s article specifically references United States legislation, there is similar legislation here in Australia; the *[Disability Discrimination Act 1992](https://www.legislation.gov.au/C2004A04426/latest/text)*. 

* **Accessibility standards exist and they are publicly available**
The idea that there are no clear standards for businesses to follow is wrong. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is a detailed framework that is used world-wide that has existed since 1999.

* **Participation in public life now happens online**
“To argue that accessibility is only important for physical building is to ignore reality.” Enough said! 

* **Accessibility is good business, not just compliance**
Accessibility is not charity or a specialised niche, its fundamental usability and it benefits everyone. Digital accessibility isn’t a fringe issue, it represents equal participation in modern life.
