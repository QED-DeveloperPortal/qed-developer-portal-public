Sample test :

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didnâ€™t find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that itâ€™ll be the last one you ever need â€“ I think this is it.

Hereâ€™s why:

Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others You shouldnâ€™t be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life ðŸ˜„ Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So Iâ€™ll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!
