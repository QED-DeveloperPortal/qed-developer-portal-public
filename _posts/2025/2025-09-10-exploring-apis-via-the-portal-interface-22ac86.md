# Overview  

This guide shows you how to explore the **API Portal interface** and test one of the APIs (in this case, the `Student-API` endpoint) directly from the sandbox — no code or external tools required.

## Step 1: Navigate to the API  

1. Log in to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.qed.qld.gov.au/).  
2. Go to the **[API Catalogue](https://developer.qed.qld.gov.au/apis/)**. You will see the following sections:
   - **Quick start** – Guides to help you learn about the API sandbox  
   - **My applications** – Create and manage application keys and view activity logs  
   - **API catalogue** – APIs exposed by DataHub for Department systems  
   - **QTeachers catalogue** – APIs exposed by the QTeachers system

3. Select one of the system/product groups, e.g., **Consent Management**.  
4. You will see a list of API groups and their endpoints. You can download the API specifications by clicking the download icon.  
5. Locate and click the **Student-API** group and select the endpoint:  
   **GET** `/student-api/schools/{zoneId}/studentpersonals`  

This will take you to the API portal, where you can test the endpoint.

## Step 2: Explore the portal interface  

The portal interface is divided into several sections:

- **Endpoint** – Displays the API group name, HTTP verb, and endpoint path  
![API endpoints](https://sadevportal3.blob.core.windows.net/root/post/3-api-portal-interface.png)
- **Model** – Shows the data model in JSON format  
- **Request** – Displays input parameters and includes **Clear** and **Execute** buttons  
- **Response** – Displays the response from the API in JSON format  

## Step 3: Explore the model  

Expand the **Model** section to see the structure of the `StudentPersonal` object returned by this API.  

Example schema:

```json
{
  "StudentPersonal": [
    {
      "LocalId": "string",
      "StateProvinceId": "string",
      "OtherIdList": [
        {
          "Type": "string",
          "Value": "string"
        }
      ],
      "PersonInfo": {
        "Name": {
          "Type": "string",
          "FamilyName": "string",
          "GivenName": "string",
          "PreferredFamilyName": "string",
          "PreferredGivenName": "string",
          "FullName": "string"
        },
        "Demographics": {
          "BirthDate": "string"
        }
      },
      "MostRecent": {
        "SchoolLocalId": "string",
        "YearLevel": {
          "Code": "string"
        },
        "Homegroup": "string"
      },
      "SIF_ExtendedElements": [
        {
          "Name": "string",
          "Text": [
            {}
          ]
        }
      ],
      "IndependentStudent": "string",
      "MedicalCondition": "string",
      "Indigenous": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```
Understanding the model helps you know what data to expect in the response.

## Step 4: Provide input parameters

Scroll to the Request section. You will see a list of input parameters such as:

![API params](https://sadevportal3.blob.core.windows.net/root/post/4-api-portal-interface.png)

Enter the required fields (e.g., zoneId = 434972).
Optional fields can be left empty unless you want to filter results.

## Step 5: Execute the request
Scroll to the Response section. You will see:
- Click Clear to reset any previous input.
- Click Execute to send the request.

The portal will call the API in real time.

## Step 6: View the response

Scroll to the Response section. You will see:

- Status code – e.g., 200 OK means the request was successful
- Response body – The JSON data returned by the API

Example response:
```json
{
  "StudentPersonal": [
    {
      "LocalId": "590529",
      "StateProvinceId": "QLD",
      "OtherIdList": [
        {
          "Type": "TFN",
          "Value": "416665353"
        }
      ],
      "PersonInfo": {
        "Name": {
          "Type": "A",
          "FamilyName": "Kuvalis",
          "GivenName": "John",
          "PreferredFamilyName": "Kihn",
          "PreferredGivenName": "Seamus",
          "FullName": "Adriana Romaguera"
        },
        "Demographics": {
          "BirthDate": "2021-09-08T04:07:47.303Z"
        }
      },
      "MostRecent": {
        "SchoolLocalId": "358588",
        "YearLevel": {
          "code": "7",
          "description": "Year 3"
        },
        "Homegroup": "Simpsons"
      },
      "SIF_ExtendedElements": [
        {
          "Name": "0360669844",
          "Text": [
            "Some sample text..."
          ]
        }
      ],
      "IndependentStudent": "Y",
      "MedicalCondition": "N",
      "Indigenous": "Y"
    }
  ]
}

```
## Next steps  

Once you have successfully tested the API in the portal, you can:

1. **Experiment with different parameters** – Try different `zoneId`, `yearLevel`, and `homeGroup` values to explore responses.  
2. **Test other endpoints** – Explore additional API groups in the portal and understand their models and parameters.  
3. **Integrate into your application** – Use the input parameters and response format as a guide to integrate the API in your code or Postman collections.  
4. **Save and share requests** – Document the request and response examples for your team.  
5. **Apply for live credentials** – Once your testing is complete, request security credentials to interact with live Department systems.  
6. **Monitor and troubleshoot** – Review API responses carefully to handle errors, missing data, or permission issues.
