## Start with WHY 
To deliver and manage better digital solutions - faster, safer, and with purpose. 

At its heart, an SDLC is not just about writing code or following process. It’s about solving real problems for real people - through technology that’s responsive, inclusive, and sustainable. 

1. **Customers first:** We build with, not just for, our users - placing their needs at the centre of every decision. 
2. **Ideas in action:** We test, learn, and adapt quickly - embracing iteration and innovation to deliver what works. 
3. **Unleash potential:** We empower teams to own their craft, grow their capabilities, and challenge the status quo. 
4. **Be courageous:** We challenge outdated practices and simplify where complexity holds us back. 
5. **Empower people:** We build systems that serve people - our colleagues, stakeholders, and the communities we support.

SDLC can be described as a combination of strategy, framework and methodology. 

* **SDLC as a strategy:** The organisational intent and purpose behind how products are delivered sustainably and successfully. 
* **SDLC as a framework:** The structure that outlines the stages of software development from idea to retirement. 
* **SDLC as a methodology:** The practices used to develop and deliver software solutions. Tools and processes like Agile, Waterfall, DevOps, Lean, HCD, SAFE, etc. 

“The SDLC is the whole process by which a digital solution is imagined, created, delivered, and evolved - to bring ongoing value to the people who use it.” 

## Guiding principles 
* **Solutions must be valuable and usable:** We listen to real users and measure success through adoption, not just delivery. 
* **Speed is nothing without safety:** We release small and often, backed by automation, QA, and safe-to-fail practices. 
* **Change is expected:** Systems must be built for adaptability - technically, culturally, and procedurally. 
* **Quality is everyone’s job:** Testing, review, and validation are embedded everyday activities, not infrequent and gated. 
* **Collaboration beats handover:** Designers, developers, testers, stakeholders and users work together throughout. It’s a team sport, not a relay. 
* **Simplicity supports flow:** Complexity breeds confusion, delay and waste. We reduce unnecessary gates, zones, and clutter. Just enough, just in time.
