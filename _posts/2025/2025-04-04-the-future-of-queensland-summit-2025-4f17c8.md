# The Future of Queensland Summit 2025  
**27 March, The Star Brisbane**

[https://fst.net.au/event/future-of-queensland-government-summit-2025/](https://fst.net.au/event/future-of-queensland-government-summit-2025/)

— *From the organisers*
*"This summit offers an ideal platform for government and industry to join forces. Beyond an inspiring plenary session, participants can engage in a range of roundtable discussions based on case studies and led by industry experts. These sessions allow attendees to ask questions, exchange ideas, and leave with actionable insights."*


> The event was professional and well-run. I had opportunities to meet several vendors and sponsors and attend a range of insightful speaker sessions and forums.

## Managing data as a valuable national asset  
**Andrew Lalor**, Assistant Secretary, Data Policy and Assurance Branch, Department of Finance

- Every agency should have a **service owner**
- **Non-sensitive data should be open by default**
- Trust depends on:
  - Tech  
  - Expectations  
  - Social licence
- People are tech savvy—and they expect government to be tech savvy too

> The idea that all non-sensitive data should be open by default really stuck with me. It challenges the culture of defensiveness and silos. The key, of course, is ensuring it’s *non-sensitive*—but there’s still plenty we could and should be sharing.
> Andrew’s reminder that the public is growing more digitally capable was also important. He suggested that agencies should empower this progress rather than fear it.

## Executive think tank  
**Panel:**
- Damian Green – Deputy Director-General, Corporate Services, Queensland Health  
- Gillian Gardiner – Executive Director, Innovation Operations, Department of Environment, Tourism, Science and Innovation  
- Mark Pozdena – General Manager, Business IT & Digital Delivery, Powerlink Queensland  
- Lucy Poole – General Manager, Strategy, Planning and Performance Division, Digital Transformation Agency  

**Key messages:**

- **Damian Green:**
  - *“Agility!”*  
  - *“Don’t make perfect the enemy of the good. Don’t talk IT – talk outcomes.”*

- **Mark Pozdena:**
  - *“Waterfall focuses on the widget – not the outcome.”*  
  - *“Share / spread the risk.”*  
  - *“Our language should not be about schedule and risk – but outcomes.”*  
  - *“We're using AI to measure user sentiment. It's about having rich data AND the tools to measure it.”*

- **Lucy Poole:**
  - *“AI has shifted the sands. Business is technology.”*  
  - *“We're trying to figure out the best approaches – best of both worlds.”*  
  - *“Community has mixed feelings about AI in government. e.g. RoboDebt – but this was not caused by AI. It has created scepticism.”*  
  - *“In reality, we do not have control anymore, should not expect to retain control.”*

- **On citizen development:**
  - *“Beware of the hype cycle i.e. High tech, but low actual outcome delivery.”*  
  - *“We need to change how we think: bring in the consumers – get clarity first.”*

- **Mark Pozdena (again):**
  - *“Customers are already using these tools. Already using them via external services.”*  
  - *“It is going to change our world – the sooner we start – the more we can shape it.”*

> This session resonated deeply. I appreciated the emphasis on outcomes over outputs—a mindset Agile, Scrum, and HCD already embrace.
> There was also an honest caution around technology hype, which we’ve experienced firsthand—cloud features that promised much, but delivered inconsistently.
> Finally, the point about customers already using these tools highlights the need to meet them where they are and shape our strategies accordingly.

## Navigating cybersecurity’s future  
**Andrew Philp**, Field CISO, ANZ, Trend Micro

*“It is our view that agencies are not ready to respond.”*

- Current state:
  - High response
  - Medium protection and detection
  - **Low prediction**
- *“Being reactive isn't enough anymore.”*
- Complexity and scale are the new attack surface
- Major issues include legacy systems and tech debt
- *“Think of data as an asset.”*
- Many agencies rely on a checkbox mentality—e.g. Essential8 and patching—as a façade of security
- What’s needed:
  - Continuous, near real-time **risk assessment**
  - Better **telemetry**
  - *“Fix what matters first.”*

> This was a sobering look at cyber preparedness. I was struck by how real the disconnect is between checklist compliance and meaningful protection.
> Andrew’s final message—*“fix what matters first”*—was a sharp and necessary reminder.

## Roundtable discussion  
**Are we ‘data rich but data selfish’?**

- Current mindset: *“Why should we share it?”*  
- Target mindset: *“Why should we hide it?”*

> This session cut to the heart of the issue: attitude. Often, it’s not about the technical capability, but a lack of will—or fear that it’ll be too hard. That mindset is holding us back.

## Embracing public service values in digital transformation  
**Scott Sheldon**, Digital Delivery Executive, DB Results

- Emphasis on *“Customers First”* to build citizen-focused services
- Successful case study: NDIS app – **4.8 stars**  
  - Government app average: **1.3–3 stars** (Feb 2025)

**How to live public service values:**

1. **Customers first** – *“Listen to your customers”*  
   - Simplify: reduced 27 website functions to 3  
   - Included CX/UAU with blind users

2. **Ideas into action** – *“Your team must know they are supported”*  
   - Protect them from unnecessary blockers

3. **Unleash potential** – *“Take calculated risks”*  
   - Requires leadership and courage

4. **Be courageous** – *“Push for better”*  
   - Embed innovation from the start

5. **Empower people** – *“Listen and acknowledge feedback EVERY DAY”*

**Success factors:**
- Leadership, vision, purpose  
- Passion  
- Fit-for-need  
- Capability to deliver  
- *“But you have to want it.”*

> This was one of the most affirming sessions for me. It reminded me of why we do what we do—and how critical empathy, listening, and innovation are to public service.
> I particularly loved the accessibility case study, which reminded me of our own UAT with visually impaired users for QTeachers. A powerful experience.

## Empowering Queensland through digital connectivity  
**Georgina Gold**, Acting Director, NSW Telco Authority

- Built the NSW Digital Connectivity Index using both **public and sensitive private data**
- Created a **conceptual prototype** first  
- Engaged users throughout  
- Delivered **two versions**: one for government, one public-facing
- *“Government must be agile—in tech and in mindset—to deliver faster.”*

> Though NSW-led, this case study had a lot to offer Qld. The bold but careful approach, and consistent user engagement, were inspiring.

## Data and AI panel discussion  
**Panel:**
- Dr Petra Kuhnert – CSIRO Data61  
- Dr Olivier Salvado – QUT  
- Joanne Kummrow – Queensland Information Commissioner  
- Nathan Bines – Department of Customer Services  

- Ongoing tension: *Access to private information vs privacy*
- *“Challenge: right-sizing policy. Public trust == greater uptake”*
- Academics have stopped trying to prevent AI use among students—*“We need to pivot”*
- AI is **forcing a rethink** of data policy
- Central question: *How do we build trust in government?*

> This was a rich, if early-stage, discussion. There are clearly more questions than answers at this point, but it’s evident that AI is reshaping our assumptions.

## Cyber panel discussion  
**Panel:**
- Darron Richardson – Southern Cross University  
- Sadeed Tirmizey – Seqwater  
- James R. Carlopio – Cultural Cyber Security  

- Perceived policy gaps often mask **literacy gaps**
- Data isn’t ready for AI – needs improved management
- Suggested approaches:
  - Start small
  - Sandbox
  - Trial
- *“Transparency is important. Keep the human in the centre – it’s all about people.”*
- *“What's the risk/challenge of government NOT using AI – but the community using it?”*
- *“High level of breach is human not technology – it’s a human issue.”*
- *“Security is seen as a technology issue – The technology will protect me! – I call this the human firewall.”*
- Need for **collaboration**—current landscape too siloed
- *“Phishing is still the top attack – Who is teaching us about this? We need cyber life skills taught in schools.”*
- *“Annual mandatory training is often quite useless.”*
- *“Understand your digital footprint.”*
- *“Our job is not policy – it is education. It’s a cultural issue, not a document issue.”*
- *“Everyone has a plan until they are punched in the face.”*  
  - BCPs fail without training
  - Run **cyber drills**, like fire drills

> While I don’t consider myself a cybersecurity expert, this session made clear that digital safety is everyone’s responsibility. I thought of the comparison to driver training—most of us don’t know how an engine works, but we still need to understand how to drive safely - and are tested accordingly.
> I feel cyber awareness should be embedded more into school curricula. Our digital natives need real preparation for the future.

## Final reflection  

> Overall, this was a highly valuable and thought-provoking summit. I came away energised—and a little challenged—to bring these lessons into my daily work, especially in how we support and engage with the Queensland education community.
