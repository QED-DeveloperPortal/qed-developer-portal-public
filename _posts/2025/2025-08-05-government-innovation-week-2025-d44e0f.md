The Public Sector Network hosts Government Innovation Week events all around the world and, this September, it's Brisbane's turn. The event runs over 3 days at the Brisbane Convention & Exhibition Centre. 

Many people from the public sector attend events like Government Innovation Week because they care about innovation, continuous improvement and delivering real-world value. If that describes you, welcome! It describes our team, too.

The Queensland Department of Education Developer Portal is your open invitation to build with us! Explore tools, collaborate on ideas, and help shape the next generation of digital education services.
