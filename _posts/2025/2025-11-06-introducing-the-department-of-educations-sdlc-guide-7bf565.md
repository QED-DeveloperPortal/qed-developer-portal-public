If you’ve ever wondered *how* software is designed, built, and deployed within the **Queensland Department of Education**, the [**QED-DeveloperPortal/SDLC**](https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/SDLC){:target="_blank"} repository is your starting point.  

This repository serves as a **comprehensive documentation portal** — designed to help developers, analysts, testers, and project teams understand the **official process and standards** that govern software delivery across the department.  

## Purpose

Whether you’re new to departmental development or looking to refresh your understanding, this documentation ensures your work meets the **required governance and compliance standards**.
