Have you ever wondered how software is designed, built and deployed in the Department of Education? If so, you are at the right place!

The GitHub repository [QED-DeveloperPortal/SDLC](https://github.com/QED-DeveloperPortal/SDLC/) is the ultimate guide to the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) created specifically for the department. 

It serves as a comprehensive documentation portal, designed to help anyone who wants to understand the process and standards that govern our software delivery life cycle.  

## Why it matters  

This repository isn’t about *how to code*, it’s about *how to build software the right way* for the department.  

By following this SDLC guide, you can ensure your work is:  
- aligned with departmental policies  
- developed using consistent and approved practices  
- secure, maintainable, and fit for purpose.  

Whether you are new in the department or looking to refresh your understanding, this documentation ensures your project meets the required governance and compliance standards and helps you to understand what's required to deliver quality solutions across our ecosystem.
