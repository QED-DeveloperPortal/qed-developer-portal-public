# Developer’s Summary

As a systems development team member, the following steps can show you how to follow DET’s SDLC process model effectively:

a) Make sure you familiarise yourself with “SDLC Principles”, “SDLC Conceptual Reference Model” and the definition of an SDLC Track, which is a “traversal” of SDLC stages. For each scope type, a different SDLC track may be applicable with certain SDLC stages, which promotes the idea that for smaller releases only a portion of the life cycle is traversed.

b) At the beginning of a systems development activity (i.e. when developing a new system that did not exist before or when developing a new release of an existing system after going through the “Release Planning and Scope Type Determination Process”), the “SDLC Track Processes” should be performed:

   a. If applicable, perform the “Life Cycle Model Management Process” to ensure the teams become aware of the organisational principles, processes and procedures around SDLC.

   b. Determine the scope type of the release according to the “Release Planning and Scope Type Determination Process” in section ‎7.11.5.2. Depending on the scope type of the release, different SDLC tracks and stages may be applicable. This process shows the SDLC stages that should be included in the development activity.

   c. When developing new features and/or when data models and/or data schemas are being modified, perform the “Preliminary Information Classification Process” according to section ‎7.3.2.

   d. If applicable, for releases including cloud-based components, perform the “Preliminary Cloud Assessment Process” according to section ‎7.3.3.

   e. Perform the “Risk Assessment Process” to determine the risk associated with the release according to section ‎7.3.4. Depending on the risk, different levels of rigor and controls may be applicable.

c) Depending on the scope type and the applicable SDLC track, follow the guidelines and ensure the highlighted process outcomes are delivered.

d) You can refer to “Appendix B – Alignment of Systems Development Method” for a quick guide on how to align mainstream systems development methods with DET’s SDLC process model.

e) It would be an anti-pattern to bundle releases of different risk profiles together since the highest risk level of the smallest piece will be applicable to the whole bundle resulting in extra overhead. The granularity at which an independent release unit is defined is left to the development teams to find the optimum balance, however, it would be sensible to isolate a single high-risk release and manage its development and artefacts separately for better traceability and transparency.

f) This process model defines the absolute minimums in terms of governance and artefacts. The development teams are free to apply extra rigor and use DET’s ICT Project Management Life Cycle and method based on their own discretion to cover “any” release types while managing and delivering them under “projects”.
