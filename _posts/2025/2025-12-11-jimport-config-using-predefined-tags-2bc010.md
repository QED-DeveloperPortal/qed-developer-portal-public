# Understanding "Hello World" in Programming

In the world of programming, **"Hello World"** is often the very first program a beginner writes. Despite its simplicity, it serves an important purpose: it demonstrates the basic syntax of a programming language and confirms that your development environment is set up correctly.

## Why "Hello World"?

- **Introductory Learning**: It’s an easy way to start learning a new programming language without getting overwhelmed.
- **Environment Check**: Running a Hello World program ensures your compiler, interpreter, or development environment is configured correctly.
- **Foundation**: It introduces you to core concepts like outputting text, statements, and program execution.

## Examples in Different Languages

### Python
```python
print("Hello World from wiki!")
```

### C#
```C#
Console.WriteLine("Hello World from C#!");
```

### Javascript
```js
console.log("Hello World from Javascript!");
```
