Mid-2024 I discovered that the Australian Public Service Commission (APSC) provides an online space where public servants can connect called **APS Professions**. I joined a handful of communities across both the digital and data professions to get a feel for the sorts of conversations members have and to see what the site offered.

Each community has its own discussion threads and a library where recordings of presentations and other resources are available. If there’s a problem you’re facing or topic you want to know more about, you’ll probably find something relevant in one of the many communities. 

In browsing the community libraries over the last 6 months I've come across some excellent presentations and there are three that really stand out that I enthusiastically recommend: 

1. [Unawkward Chats on Disability and Digital Access](https://youtu.be/8KNI8gl6sUg?si=6lWiuoaU3M50yhdF) with a panel of guests from [See Me Please](https://www.seemeplease.com/).
1. [Good Content](https://community.apsprofessions.gov.au/viewdocument/good-content-with-sarah-winters?CommunityKey=21f41dd6-3d85-43e4-b8f4-80ab6cea5b97&tab=librarydocuments) with Sarah Winters from Content Design London.
1. [The Department of Christmas Affairs](https://community.apsprofessions.gov.au/viewdocument/december-2022-meetup-department-o?CommunityKey=e7a59ee2-ca79-44bf-8c46-c673aaba78f4&tab=librarydocuments) – serious lessons from a silly website.

(Number 1 is a link directly to the presentation on YouTube. To view numbers 2 and 3, you need to be an APS Professions member.)

If this sounds like something you're interested in and your work email ends in **.gov.au** you can join! Visit [community.apsprofessions.gov.au](https://community.apsprofessions.gov.au/) and click the 'Sign up' button.
