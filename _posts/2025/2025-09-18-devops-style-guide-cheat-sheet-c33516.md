## Minimise capitalisation

Use sentence case for headings; capitalise the first word and proper nouns only.

## Government department references

The first or a specific reference to a government department should be in title case but the second or a generic reference should be lower case.

## Use Australian spelling

Despite extensive training and careful prompting, generative AI cannot be trusted to always use Australian spelling. Refer to the current edition of the Macquarie Dictionary and the [Australian Government _Style Manual_](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/) for general spelling and style guidance.

## Dictionary guidance

Where the Macquarie Dictionary gives two spellings of the same word, use the first spelling.

## Short sentences

Use short sentences with no more than about 20 words.

## Plain English

Use plain English and avoid jargon. Choose words that people are familiar with. Unfamiliar words make content harder to read and understand.
