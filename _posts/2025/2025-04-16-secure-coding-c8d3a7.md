**Overview**  
To reduce security vulnerabilities and improve software quality, **secure coding principles** must be consistently applied throughout development. These principles ensure that code is not only functional and maintainable but also *resilient to misuse, malicious input, and unintended behaviour*.

Secure code is the foundation of trustworthy systems. It enables long-term sustainability, rapid feature delivery, and reduced incident response burden.



### Key secure coding principles

| Principle | Best practice controls |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Input validation & output encoding** | All user input must be treated as untrusted. Validate early, encode outputs, and avoid dynamic code execution. Apply allow-lists where possible. |
| **Fail securely** | Code should fail gracefully without leaking sensitive information. Error messages must be generic to users and detailed only in logs. |
| **Authentication & authorisation checks** | Ensure all critical functions enforce both identity and permissions. Never assume context or rely solely on front-end checks. |
| **Secure dependency management** | Limit third-party dependencies. Use trusted sources, specify versions explicitly, and automate vulnerability checks (e.g., with **Dependabot**, **Snyk**). |
| **Secrets & configuration management** | Never hardcode secrets or credentials. Use environment-specific secrets vaults (e.g., **Azure Key Vault**, **GitHub Secrets**). Ensure config files are not stored in public or shared repos. |
| **Defensive coding & code hygiene** | Assume your code will be attacked. Use safe defaults, initialise variables, avoid unsafe functions (e.g., `eval`, raw SQL). Write clean, modular, well-documented code. |
| **Logging & monitoring hooks** | Include meaningful logs for key events such as authentication attempts, permission errors, and data mutations. Never log passwords or sensitive tokens. |
| **Memory & resource management** | Avoid memory leaks, uncontrolled recursion, or unbounded data processing. Be aware of DoS and resource exhaustion risks. |
| **Immutable infrastructure & infrastructure as code** | Ensure infrastructure changes are applied via code rather than manual edits to enforce consistency and traceability. |
| **Code review & pairing** | Regular peer reviews and optional pairing promote early identification of potential security risks and encourage team-wide knowledge sharing. |


### Tools and controls for secure coding

| Tool / practice | purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **ESLint / Prettier** | Linting and formatting for consistent, safe JS/TS code |
| **SonarQube** | Detects code smells, vulnerabilities, and insecure patterns |
| **GitHub Advanced Security / CodeQL** | Automated code scanning and security alerts |
| **Dependabot / Snyk** | Alerts on vulnerable dependencies and suggests patches |
| **OWASP Secure coding guidelines** | Language-specific cheat sheets (e.g., for JavaScript, C#, Python) |
| **Code review checklists** | Include secure coding prompts: input validation, secrets, logging, etc. |
| **Automated test coverage reports** | Ensure high coverage of logic and edge cases |
| **Secrets detection** | Git hooks or scanners to prevent committing sensitive data |
| **CI/CD quality gates** | Prevent merging code that fails security, style, or test checks |

### A continuous culture

Secure coding is not a one-off activityâ€”it must be a **habitual, team-wide practice**. To support this:

- Developers should have access to **secure coding checklists and OWASP resources**.
- **Security champions** can guide teams and help interpret threats or trade-offs.
- **Code reviews** should be fast but purposeful, supporting mentoring and critical feedback.
- Teams should be encouraged to **refactor and address tech debt**, on a continual right-size/right-time basis.
- Digital applications are living products - Product Managers should ensure that operating systems, frameworks, and dependencies **remain up to date**. Running on **outdated software introduces unnecessary and often critical risk** to service integrity and security.
