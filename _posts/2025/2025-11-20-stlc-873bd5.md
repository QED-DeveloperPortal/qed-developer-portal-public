The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a comprehensive, value-driven framework that ensures software quality through various testing types, including functional, regression, integration, system, UAT, and non-functional testing. It emphasizes early defect detection, continuous feedback, and alignment with business goals, with testers playing a crucial role as quality advocates. Automation tools are integrated across the testing life cycle to accelerate feedback, ensure test consistency, and reduce manual effort, supporting both shift-left and shift-right testing philosophies. The STLC framework fosters trust in software releases, promotes continuous learning, and ensures that digital solutions meet real user needs, with a focus on quality as a cultural value. This structured approach not only aims to deliver reliable, secure, and user-friendly products but also empowers testers to contribute to the overall quality and usability of the software. The STLC framework is adaptable, continuously evolving with the product, and is designed to build confidence in solutions, manage risk effectively, and deliver meaningful outcomes.
