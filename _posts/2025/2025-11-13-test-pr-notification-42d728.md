## **1. Information Security Assessment (ISA)**

To modernise the Information Security Assessment (ISA) process within the QED SDLC, the organisation could shift from a single, late-stage compliance checkpoint to an embedded, continuous security assurance practice woven into every phase of delivery. The legacy model — conducting a comprehensive ISA only just before production release — often resulted in costly rework, delayed deployments, and reactive risk management.
