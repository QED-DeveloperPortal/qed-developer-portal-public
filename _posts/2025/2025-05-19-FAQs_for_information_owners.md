## 1. How does the information import function work?
 
- Once we have the information's location and the information owner's consent, the portal can automatically draw the information from its source, transform it into the required [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format, summarise the content and publish the information in a post. For a more detailed explanation,
- All posts created this way will be automatically tagged with 'Auto-import' so we can distinguish between information created and imported.

## 2. Does this mean I'll lose control of my information once it's published?

- Not at all! The portal is only holding up a mirror to show useful information that lives elsewhere. We want to make useful information visible without duplicating it. Your source material will always be the single point of truth.

## 3. What if I don't want my information on the Developer Portal?

- If you don't want to make your information available via the Developer Portal then we won't import it.

## 4. What if the information is too long or complex for a blog post?

- By using AI-powered transformation, the portal can easily summarise lengthy and/or complex information. Or you can choose to publish an original summary of the information yourself.

## 5. Who will have access to view my information if I agree to import it?

- If you're happy for your information to be viewed by internal *and* external users, publish a public post; otherwise you can publish an internal post so only users with an internal role can view it.
- We use [role-based access controls](https://developer.qed.qld.gov.au/public/Role-based_access_mapping_in_the_Developer_Portal/) to allow only credentialed users to view internal information.

## 6. What if the 'single source of truth' changes?

- If the *location* of the information changes, let us know and we can easily adjust.
- If the *content* of the information changes, there are a few options to consider. For infrequent changes, a manual request/refresh might be sufficient.  For frequent changes, we can set up an automatic import refresh on a regular cycle.

## 7. What information could I share?

- Anything you want our developer community to know!
- Browse the topic [tags](https://developer.qed.qld.gov.au/tags/) to get a feel for the for the information already available.

## 8. How do I start?

- Email us at [developer@qed.qld.gov.au](mailto:developer@qed.qld.gov.au) to start the conversation with our team. We'd love to hear from you!

 Here's a simplified workflow that steps out the import/update/remove info process:
