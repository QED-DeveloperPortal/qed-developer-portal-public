## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): A Value Driven Approach

A departmental approach to delivering successful digital solutions.

### TL;DR
Our SDLC is a value-driven framework for delivering and managing digital solutions that are fast, safe, and centred on real user needs. It balances strategy, structure, and agility - empowering teams to build meaningful, evolving products through continuous quality, collaboration, and purpose.

### What is a SDLC?
Before we try to define how to implement SDLC, we should unpack what it is.

- **Software** – not just code, but a digital product created to solve real problems.
- **Delivery** – the act of placing something tangible and desirable into the hands of those who want it, when they need it.
- **Life** – The digital product is alive. It does not exist in a vacuum. It should evolve, adapt and respond to its environment.
- **Cycle** – Development is not linear but cyclic. It will move and loop through various phases during its existence.

SDLC can be described as a combination of strategy, framework and methodology.

- **SDLC as a strategy**: The organisational intent and purpose behind how products are delivered sustainably and successfully.
- **SDLC as a framework**: The structure that outlines the stages of software development from idea to retirement.
- **SDLC as a methodology**: The practices used to develop and deliver software solutions. Tools and processes like Agile, Waterfall, DevOps, Lean, HCD, SAFE, etc.

> “The SDLC is the whole process by which a digital solution is imagined, created, delivered, and evolved - to bring ongoing value to the people who use it.”
