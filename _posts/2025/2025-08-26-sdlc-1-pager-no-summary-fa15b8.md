# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): A Value-Driven Approach

## Overview
A departmental approach to delivering successful digital solutions.

### TL;DR
Our SDLC is a value-driven framework for delivering and managing digital solutions that are fast, safe, and centered on real user needs. It balances strategy, structure, and agility—empowering teams to build meaningful, evolving products through continuous quality, collaboration, and purpose.

## What is SDLC?
Before we define how to implement SDLC, let's unpack what it is.

- **Software**: Not just code, but a digital product created to solve real problems.
- **Delivery**: The act of placing something tangible and desirable into the hands of those who want it, when they need it.
- **Life**: The digital product is alive. It does not exist in a vacuum. It should evolve, adapt, and respond to its environment.
- **Cycle**: Development is not linear but cyclic. It will move and loop through various phases during its existence.

## Components of SDLC
SDLC can be described as a combination of strategy, framework, and methodology:

1. **SDLC as a Strategy**: 
   - The organizational intent and purpose behind how products are delivered sustainably and successfully.

2. **SDLC as a Framework**: 
   - The structure that outlines the stages of software development from idea to retirement.

3. **SDLC as a Methodology**: 
   - The practices used to develop and deliver software solutions, including tools and processes like:
     - Agile
     - Waterfall
     - DevOps
     - Lean
     - Human-Centered Design (HCD)
     - Scaled Agile Framework (SAFE)

## Conclusion
“The SDLC is the whole process by which a digital solution is imagined, created, delivered, and evolved—to bring ongoing value to the people who use it.”
