## What is Postman?  

Postman is a user-friendly tool that simplifies API testing. It provides a graphical interface that lets you send requests, view responses, and debug APIs without needing to write code or use the command line.  

## Why use Postman?  

Using Postman makes it easy to:  

- quickly test APIs with a simple point-and-click interface  
- save and organise API requests into collections for reuse  
- experiment with different parameters, headers, and request types  
- view structured responses (JSON, XML, etc.) instantly.

## Installing Postman  

Download and install Postman from the official website:  [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)  

Choose the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux) and follow the installation steps.  

## Testing one of our APIs in Postman 

### Step 1: Create a new request 
- Open Postman and click the *New* button next to the *My Workspace* column to create a new request.

- Select **HTTP** from the list of available options.

### Step 2: Set the request type
   - You will see that **GET** is selected by default.  
   - Other common request types include `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` but for this first request, we'll use `GET`.  

### Step 3. Enter the request URL
- Set the URL to:  
     ```
     https://dp-mockaco.azurewebsites.net/BOOK/staff-api/schools/434972/staffpersonals
     ```  
- This calls the `/staff-api/schools/{zoneId}/staffpersonals` endpoint under the **Booking System** category.

### Step 4: Add the API key header
   - Go to the **Headers** tab.  
   - Add a new header:  
     - **Key:** `x-api-key`  
     - **Value:** *(your API key from 'My applications')*

### Step 5: Send the request
- Click *Send* (or *Execute* depending on your version).  
- After a few seconds, you should see a JSON response from the server.

### Whatâ€™s next?
Now that you have successfully sent a `GET` request, try experimenting with:  

- **changing parameters** in the URL (e.g., using a different `zoneId`)  
- **exploring other HTTP methods** such as `POST` or `PUT` (when available)  
- **saving your request** into a Postman Collection for reuse later.

> You can also export and share your Postman collections with your team so everyone can test with the same setup.
