Test cricket is considered the best format because it is a comprehensive test of a cricketer's skill, endurance, and mental strength, combining technical, tactical, and physical elements over up to five days.

The unpredictability of changing conditions, such as weather and pitch deterioration, adds layers of complexity that showcase a wider range of a player's abilities.
