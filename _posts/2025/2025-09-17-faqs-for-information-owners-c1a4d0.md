## 1. Why show information on the Developer Portal?
- It's a place where internal and external developers can find information relevant to their work for the department. The more practical information they can find in a single place, the better for everyone.

## 2. How does it work? 
- Once we have the information's location and your consent, the portal can automatically target the information, transform it into the required [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) format, summarise the content (if required) and display the information in a post.

- All information shown this way will be automatically tagged with 'Auto-import' and will bear the avatar of its source location (Content Manager, DevOps or GitHub), so users can easily distinguish between published departmental information and posts created by a member/author.

## 3. Does this mean I'll lose control of my information once it's displayed?
- Not at all! The portal is only displaying information that lives elsewhere. We want to make useful information visible _without duplicating it_. Your source material will always be the single point of truth and you will retain responsibility for keeping it current and accurate.
- The post will also contain a link back to the source so anyone who wants to view the information in its native location can do that (assuming they have the necessary access).

## 4. What if I don't want my information on the Developer Portal? 
- If you don't want to make your information available via the Developer Portal then we won't display it.

## 5. What if the information is too long or complex for a single page?
- Our summarisation service can transform lengthy and/or complex information. The service will also include a link back to the single point of truth for those who want to go deeper.

## 6. Who will have access to view my information if I agree to share it?
- Everything on the site defaults to being visible for everyone. Because we hold all developers to the same standards of security, interoperability and accessibility, it's right and fair that we are transparent about what those standards are. Our information should be available to everyone, including vendors, partner developers, future ventures, schools and hobbyists.

## 7. What if I change the location of the source information?
- If the location of the information changes but it's still in Content Manager, DevOps or GitHub, let us know and we can easily adjust. 

## 8. What happens when the source content is updated?
- For infrequent changes, a manual request/refresh might be sufficient. 
- For frequent changes, we can set up an automatic refresh on a regular cycle. 

## 9. How can I remove my listing? 
- Email us at [developer@qed.qld.gov.au](mailto:developer@qed.qld.gov.au) to let us know what you want removed and we'll remove it.

## 10. What information could I share? 
- Anything you want our developer community to know! 
- Browse the topic [tags](https://developer.qed.qld.gov.au/tags/) to get a feel for the information already available. 

## 11. How do I view my information on the Developer Portal? 
- Once listed, the information will have its own URL which we will share with you.

## 12. Can I share the link to my content with others? 
- Absolutely! 

## 13. How do I start?
- Email us at [developer@qed.qld.gov.au](mailto:developer@qed.qld.gov.au) to start the conversation with our team.

We look forward to hearing from you!
