The Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC) is a comprehensive, value-driven framework that ensures software quality through various testing types, including functional, regression, integration, system, UAT, and non-functional testing. It emphasizes early defect detection, continuous feedback, and alignment with business goals, with testers playing a crucial role as quality advocates. Automation tools are integrated across the testing life cycle to accelerate feedback, increase coverage, and reduce manual effort, supporting both shift-left and shift-right testing philosophies. The STLC framework fosters trust in software releases by delivering reliable, secure, and user-friendly products, while promoting continuous learning and improvement among teams. This structured approach not only manages risk but also empowers testers to contribute to the overall quality and usability of digital solutions. The STLC's history reflects an evolution from end-of-cycle testing to an embedded, iterative process that values user-centred validation and outcome-focused metrics.
