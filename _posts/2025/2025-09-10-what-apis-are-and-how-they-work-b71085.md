### What is an API?
Think of an **API** as a **school receptionist**:

- You (the caller) ask for something → *“What’s today’s timetable for Year 9 Science?”*  
- The receptionist (API) checks the system.  
- You get a neat, structured reply (in **JSON**, like a printed timetable sheet).  

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation):**  
Like a **report card** – it uses labels and values.

```json
{
  "subject": "Science",
  "teacher": "Ms. Smith",
  "room": "B204"
}
```
