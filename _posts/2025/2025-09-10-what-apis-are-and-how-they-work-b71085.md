### Overview
This post is the perfect place to start if you are new to APIs. 

---

### What is an API?
An **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a **standard way for two software systems to communicate with each other**. You can think of it as a bridge between your application and another system.
It allows one software system to request information or trigger an action in another application in a safe, consistent and controlled manner.

In simpler terms, an API acts as a **messenger**:  
- It receives a request from your application  
- Passes that request to the appropriate system  
- Returns the response back to your application  

For example:
- A weather application sends a request to a weather API: *"What is the current temperature in Brisbane?"* The API responds: *"23Â°C, sunny."*

### A Department of Education analogy
- **School office reception (Staff directory)**
The staff API is like the school reception desk. Your app can ask *"Who are the teachers in Year 4?"* and receive the just the relevant staff details, and not every HR record.

- **Class attendance roll (Attendance API )**
An attendance API records student presence or absence and shares it with other authorised systems like QParents.

### How APIs work - The basics
The process can be summarised in three steps:
1. **Send a request**
Your application sends a request to the API specifying the data or action required. For example, "Give me a list of staff at school Brisbane State High School".

2. **Process the request**
The API validates your request (using your application key), then retrieves the relevant data or performs the requested action.

3. **Receive a response**
The API returns the result in a standard format (typically JSON) that your application can use.

### Why you should care
APIs make it easy to
- access up-to-date, accurate data
- save time - no manual data entry
- build apps and dashboards that update automatically
