**Overview**  
To ensure systems are securely designed, implemented, and operated across their lifecycle, we must apply modern, adaptable **engineering principles** rooted in transparency, modularity, and resilience. These principles are not fixed rules—they are *living standards* shaped by experience, emerging threats, and user context.

The Department draws upon both industry guidance and internal policy to continuously refine its architecture and engineering approach.


### Core engineering principles for secure systems

| Principle | Best practice controls |
|----------|------------------------|
| **Separation of concerns** | Architect systems so that **logic, data, and presentation** layers are clearly separated. This promotes security isolation and easier updates. Applied in our Developer Portal using modular architecture and microservices. |
| **Least privilege & zero trust** | Systems and services should only have the minimum access required. Use **role-based access controls (RBAC)** and **environmental separation**. Avoid “trusted” zones—assume compromise and validate every action. |
| **Modular, composable design** | Build systems from small, well-defined, independently testable components. This enables **scoped security controls**, faster incident response, and safe re-use. |
| **Secure defaults & hardening** | Every system should use secure defaults—e.g., encrypted connections, disabled open ports, logging enabled by default. Infrastructure as Code (IaC) should enforce these (e.g., Bicep, Terraform with security baselines). |
| **Defence in depth** | Security controls must not rely on a single layer. Combine **network rules, application firewalls, validation checks, and secure user journeys** to guard against multi-vector threats. |
| **Change responsiveness** | Architectures must anticipate change. Use **API-first design**, **contract testing**, and **event-driven services** to support continuous integration while maintaining security boundaries. |
| **Proven patterns, not rigid templates** | Encourage use of proven design patterns, but allow deviation when context demands it. Every architecture should be critically assessed—not copied unthinkingly. |
| **Observability and traceability** | Build in monitoring from day one. Use **application logs, distributed tracing, and structured audit events** to support incident response and continuous improvement. |
| **Documentation through living artefacts** | Use lightweight, version-controlled architectural artefacts (e.g., markdown READMEs, diagrams as code) that evolve alongside the system, not static DOCs or PDFs that become outdated. |
| **Human-centred design** | Security must not come at the cost of usability. Systems should be co-designed with users and stakeholders to ensure secure behaviour is natural, not burdensome. |



### Supporting tools & frameworks

| Tool / Technique | Purpose |
|------------------|---------|
| **Azure DevOps pipelines** | Secure, auditable CI/CD pipelines with defined approval gates and secret injection |
| **GitHub with feature branching** | Clear, auditable change history; supports modular secure development |
| **SonarQube / ESLint** | Code quality and vulnerability scanning for every commit |
| **Dependabot / Snyk** | Automated dependency scanning and patch suggestions |
| **Terraform / Bicep** | Infrastructure as Code for secure, repeatable deployments |
| **OWASP Cheat Sheets & ASVS** | Reference security checklists for architectural decisions |
| **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** | Version-controlled architectural reasoning that evolves with the solution |

### Continuous alignment and refinement

- Architecture should not be a one-time exercise. Systems must **evolve in alignment with emerging risks**, technologies, and use-cases.
- Teams should **review architectural decisions regularly** as part of retrospectives or feature reviews.
- **Security architects and engineering leads** are encouraged to share lessons learned and reusable patterns across teams.
- Ongoing support should be made available via **Communities of Practice (COP)** and **review forums**.
