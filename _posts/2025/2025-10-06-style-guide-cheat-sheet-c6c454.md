Minimise capitalisation. Use sentence case for headings; capitalise the first word and proper nouns only.

The first or a specific reference to a government department should be in title case but the second or a generic reference should be lower case.

Use Australian spelling. Despite extensive training and careful prompting, generative AI cannot be trusted to always use Australian spelling. Refer to the current edition of the Macquarie Dictionary and the [Australian Government _Style Manual_](https://www.stylemanual.gov.au/) for general spelling and style guidance.

Where the Macquarie Dictionary gives two spellings of the same word, use the first spelling.

Use short sentences with no more than about 20 words.

Use plain English and avoid jargon. Choose words that people are familiar with. Unfamiliar words make content harder to read and understand.
