**What is Application Catalogue?**

Application Catalogue is the name of the Department of Education's internal service that exposes APIs to enable internal and external vendor applications to interact with data and systems that are internal to the Department.

Application Catalogue is the gatekeeper for such access and interactions.

**What Application Catalogue Groups are available?**

Application Catalogue provides a consistent base URL (https://api.qed.qld.gov.au) for all API interactions for systems that have gone live. You can apply for security credentials once the application you have developed has been vetted by the Department.

While testing against DevPortal the base URL is https://dp-mockaco.azurewebsites.net.

Application Catalogue currently has the following groups of APIs:

* Consent Management
* Attendance/Roll Marking
* Booking Systems
* DOE Test Clients
* Library Management Systems
* SMS/Text Messaging Providers
* Student Management
* Student Management Publisher

There are also three QTeachers groups:

* Rollmarking
* Staff
* Student

More APIs and Groups will be added as they become available.
