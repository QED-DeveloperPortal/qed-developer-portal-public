**What is API catalogue?**

API catalogue is where you can find Department APIs to develop, test and eventually deploy against.

All APIs are OpenAPI compatible and their specifications are downloadable.

You can try them out within APIs section of the DevPortal website or you can run them from API test suites like Postman or from your own applications.
 
The API Catalogue currently has the following groups of APIs:

* Consent Management
* Attendance/Roll Marking
* Booking Systems
* DOE Test Clients
* Library Management Systems
* SMS/Text Messaging Providers
* Student Management
* Student Management Publisher

There are also three QTeachers groups:

* Rollmarking
* Staff
* Student

**Where did API catalogue come from?**

DataHub is the name of the Department of Education's internal service and team that exposes APIs to enable internal and external vendor applications to interact with data and systems that are internal to the Department.

API Catalogue is our expression of the APIs that DataHub provides so that you can rapidly develop and test applications that integrate with the Department.

While testing against the APIs that we surface through API catalogue the base URL is https://dp-mockaco.azurewebsites.net.

DataHub provides a consistent base URL (https://api.qed.qld.gov.au) for all API interactions for systems that have gone live. You can apply for security credentials once the application you have developed has been approved by the Department.

More APIs and Groups will be added as they are made available by the DataHub team.
