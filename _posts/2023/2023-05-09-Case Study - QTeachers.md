### Audience
This case study is for designers, developers, and product owners who are interested in mobile application development within the Department of Education.

### Introduction
The QTeachers Mobile Application (formerly known as OneSchool Mobile Experience) is an example of an excellent mobile application development project in several ways:

1. User experience (UX): The project incorporated many of the department's recent Enterprise UX audit findings, with an emphasis on user engagement and persona-based design principles.
2. User interface (UI): The interface was designed to be mobile-friendly and accessible from the start.
3. Architecture: Security-by-design and offline-first design principles were at the heart of the application's design.
4. Microservices: Early API experience influenced many of the Data Hub's enterprise characteristics.
5. Product management: QTeachers was one of the department's first Agile projects, and the project team learned a lot while aligning modern Agile with the existing PRINCE2 frameworks.

### Goals and objectives
In addition to creating a user-friendly mobile application specifically for teachers inside and outside the classroom, the team also aimed to establish mobile design patterns that were repeatable and scalable.

### Context
The application was a part of two broader initiatives - to reduce the administrative burden on teaching staff and to modernize components of the department's ecosystem.

### Approach
The team employed Scrum/Agile and Lean design methodologies to plan, design, and develop the application.
Along with internal stakeholders, a group of interested teachers were appointed as 'Change champions' to be part of the ongoing UX journey.
Initially, a prototype was created using Progressive Web App (PWA) technology and then tested in a select group of schools. Based on business and technical feedback, the project shifted to the near-native Xamarin framework.
The primary reason for the architectural change was the need for secure and reliable offline data management.
The Change champions stayed involved through various channels, including a dedicated Teams forum.
