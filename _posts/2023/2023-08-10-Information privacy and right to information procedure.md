### **Personal information**

Personal information is primarily protected under the  [_Information Privacy Act 2009_  (Qld) External link](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-014)  which legislates how the department will:

-   collect, store, use and disclose personal information about people (employees, students etc.)

-   allow people to request changes or amendments to this information.

For supporting information relating to protection of personal information, refer to the  [Personal information guideline  (DOCX, 1MB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/personal-information-guideline.docx).

### **Collection of personal information**

Employees when collecting personal information must:

-   only collect personal information directly from the individual, as required to carry out the tasks directly related to the functions and activities of the business unit or school
-   only use departmental approved forms, questionnaires, interviews, survey tools or other tools used to collect personal information
-   provide a privacy notice (see  [Personal information guideline  (DOCX, 1MB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/personal-information-guideline.docx)) to the individual on collection of their personal information.

### **Security of personal information**

Employees must apply protection to the personal information they control by:

-   classifying personal information with an  [information security classification External link](https://intranet.qed.qld.gov.au/Services/InformationTechnology/information-management/Pages/information-security-classification.aspx)  (DoE employees only) and applying security controls accordingly
-   [protecting and securing personal information External link](https://intranet.qed.qld.gov.au/Services/InformationTechnology/information-management/Pages/information-security-classification.aspx)  (DoE employees only) in both paper and digital formats and on mobile devices from loss, unauthorised access, use, modification or disclosure, and any other misuse
-   reporting any loss of personal information to their manager, director or principal
-   not emailing student personal information outside the department’s corporate network.

### **Provision of personal information**

The department publishes details of the type of personal information it holds, for what purpose and use on the  [How do I access information? External link](https://qed.qld.gov.au/about-us/rti/how-do-i-access-information)  web page.

An individual whose information is held by the department has the right to expect that any access is permitted only for authorised purposes. Employees must:

-   seek approval from their director, principal or above to undertake requests by individuals to access and amend their personal information
-   when processing requests, undertake  [identity authentication  (DOCX, 431KB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/identity-id-and-access-management-guideline.docx)  to be satisfied as to the requestor's identity or the identity of the parent or guardian for an individual under 18 years, and their right to access or amend the personal information

### **Checking accuracy of personal information**

Employees must check the accuracy, completeness and currency of personal information before use.

For further guidance on checking accuracy of personal information, refer to the  [Personal information guideline  (DOCX, 1MB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/personal-information-guideline.docx).

### **Use and disclosure of personal information**

Employees must only use personal information for the purpose for which it was collected, unless the individual concerned has consented to the use of the information for another purpose or an exception applies (see the  [Personal information guideline  (DOCX, 1MB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/personal-information-guideline.docx)) for details. Any approved use must be recorded in the individual's file or in the system where the personal information is stored.

Directors, principals or above who authorise requests for disclosure of personal information must:

-   ensure requests for disclosure of personal information are in writing and provide justification for why the information is required (see  [Obtaining and managing student and individual consent procedure](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/pp/obtaining-and-managing-student-and-individual-consent-procedure))
-   ensure the individual concerned is aware of, or has consented to that disclosure
-   advise the recipient in writing to not use or disclose the personal information for a purpose other than the purpose for which it was provided
-   ensure the disclosure:
    -   is authorised by law to do so

The Director, Integrity and Assessment, Integrity and Employee Relations will refer the complaint, if necessary, to the:

-   Crime and Corruption Commission (CCC) as required under section 38 of the  [_Crime and Corruption Act 2001_  (Qld) External link](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/2017-06-05/act-2001-069), or
-   Legal and Administrative Law Branch if a complaint proceeds to the Office of the Information Commissioner or Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT).

In some instances it may be necessary for a matter to be referred to the Director, Integrity and Assessment, Integrity and Employee Relations from the CCC for investigation in relation to a potential breach of the Queensland Government’s  [Code of Conduct for the Queensland Public Service External link](https://qed.qld.gov.au/working-with-us/induction/department/induction-programs-and-resources/code-of-conduct), the  [Standard of Practice External link](https://qed.qld.gov.au/working-with-us/induction/department/induction-programs-and-resources/code-of-conduct)  and/or the  [_Public Service Act 2008_  (Qld) External link](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2008-038).

### **Privacy breaches**

Any employee who suspects a breach of privacy must report it to their supervisor, manager, director or principal and email the  [privacy mailbox](mailto:privacy@qed.qld.gov.au). The supervisor or manager will liaise with the department’s  [Privacy Officer](mailto:privacy@qed.qld.gov.au)  to take necessary action.

### **Information release, access and use**

The department has a number of ways in which members of the community, employees, students and parents/guardians can access information held by the department. The department provides government information to the public to the maximum extent possible, unless on balance it is contrary to the public interest to do so.

Information held by a regional office or central office is also accessed in accordance with the  [Administrative access scheme for central and regional offices  (DOCX, 887KB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/administrative-access-scheme-for-central-and-regional-offices.docx)  process. Access to school related information follows  [Access to records held in schools](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/pp/access-to-records-held-in-schools-procedure)  procedure. Employees can access their own records through the Human Resources Branch in accordance with the  [Public Service Regulation 2018 (Qld) External link](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/sl-2018-0124).

Employees must be aware that any information held in the department (documents, data, emails, text messages, etc. including personal correspondence) can be made available and/or released to the public under  [_Right to Information Act 2009_  (Qld) External link](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-013)  (RTI) by:

-   proactive publication to the website under 'published information' within specified categories of information (also known as a publication scheme)
-   an administrative release where information is released to an individual or organisation at their request without having to lodge a formal RTI and Information Privacy Application, or
-   a formal  [RTI and Information Privacy Access Application External link](https://qed.qld.gov.au/aboutus/rti/Documents/right-to-information-application-form.pdf#search=right%20to%20information%20request)  where the information and/or its metadata is published under the disclosure log on the department's website. Personal information requested under the  [_Information Privacy Act 2009_  (Qld) External link](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2009-014)  also follows this process. This formal application for government-held information should only be made as a last resort.

If an employee receives a request for information they must, in consultation with an Information Access Officer in their business unit, determine which process for release is to be followed considering:

-   any requests for information from the media is directly forwarded to the Strategic Community Engagement at  [media@qed.qld.gov.au](mailto:media@qed.qld.gov.au)
-   request for the release of closed or restricted records including those held at Queensland State Archives is to be forwarded to the Director, Information and Governance Management, Information and Technologies Branch as under the  [_Public Records Act 2002_  (Qld) External link](https://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/view/html/inforce/current/act-2002-011)  they may require authorisation for release by the Deputy Director-General, Corporate Services, Assistant Director-General, Information and Technologies, Executive Director, Digital Transformation, Information and Technologies Branch or school Principal (who are authorised by the Director-General to set and change restricted access periods and approve access to restricted records)
-   the information that is to be released complies with the  [Information asset and recordkeeping](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/pp/information-asset-and-recordkeeping-procedure)  procedure
-   the department supports the exchange of government information with other government entities where there is a business need and it is permitted or required by legislation
-   if it has been determined the information can be released directly to the department's website under the publication scheme the Information Access Officer coordinates with Web and Digital Production, Information and Technologies Branch via  [Services Catalogue Online External link](https://qldqed.service-now.com/sco/)  (DoE employees only) or email  [webworkrequest@qed.qld.gov.au](mailto:webworkrequest@qed.qld.gov.au)  to release the information
-   the  [Administrative access scheme  (DOCX, 887KB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/administrative-access-scheme-for-central-and-regional-offices.docx)  process must be followed for administrative releases
-   the information must be provided to the maximum extent possible free of charge
-   where unable to provide administrative release or a direct release, direct the requesting party to the  [department's website External link](https://qed.qld.gov.au/about-us/rti/how-do-i-access-information)  to make a formal RTI and/or Information Privacy Application.

Employees receiving a request for information requested under a  [RTI and Information Privacy Access Application External link](https://qed.qld.gov.au/aboutus/rti/Documents/right-to-information-application-form.pdf#search=right%20to%20information%20request)  are to:

-   take all reasonable steps to locate relevant documents (both electronic or hardcopy documents) and respond by the due date set by the Information Release Unit, Legal and Administrative Law Branch this includes:
    -   any paper or other material on which there is writing
    -   any paper or other material on which there are marks, figures, symbols or perforations having a meaning for a person qualified to interpret them; and
    -   any disc, tape or other article or any material from which sounds, images, writings or messages are capable or being produced or reproduced (with or without the aid of another article or device).
-   understand that if they do not provide all relevant documents the department and its officers may have to defend their conduct before the Information Commissioner or the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT). It could also result in an adverse report to Parliament about the department's non-compliance
-   keep an accurate record of time spent searching for and retrieving the documents. However, the time spent by employees in photocopying, collating or searching for documents where they should have been stored, but are not found to reside there, cannot be recorded by the employee undertaking these tasks.

An employee who has been delegated the role of Information Access Officer for their business unit is to:

-   provide advice on right to information and information privacy requests
-   coordinate within the required timeframes approval processes including searching for the required information/documents consulting with Legal and Administrative Law Branch, when required
-   prepare and advise on the administrative release of information following the  [Administrative Access Scheme  (DOCX, 887KB)](https://ppr.qed.qld.gov.au/attachment/administrative-access-scheme-for-central-and-regional-offices.docx)  process
-   create records where necessary within an authorised recordkeeping system of the original request and documents
-   seek necessary approval according to the required process.

Manager, director or above must:
