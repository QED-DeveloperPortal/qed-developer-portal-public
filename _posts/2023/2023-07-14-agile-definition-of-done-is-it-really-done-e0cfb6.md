## Introduction

To understanding the '**Definition of Done**', it is imperative to understand what counts as being "done". As per Scrum Guide, every sprint is meant to add value to the product by producing usable, shippable deliverables i.e. **increments**.

> As per Scrum Guide, an increment is a concrete stepping stone towards the Product Goal and each increment is additive to all prior increments, thoroughly verified, ensuring that all increments work together.

A Product Backlog item becomes an increment once it meets the Definition of Done.

> Definition of Done is a formal description of the state of the increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.

It is a shared understanding within Scrum team on what it takes to make a PBI releasable. It may vary significantly for every Scrum team. and is used to access when work is complete on the product Increment.
