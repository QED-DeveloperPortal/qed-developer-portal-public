Here are some standard policies and procedures to consider when developing a project for government:

This includes conducting regular project status meetings, progress reports, and communication plans to ensure everyone is informed of project developments and changes.

Ensure that the project complies with all applicable government regulations, policies, and procedures, including procurement regulations, environmental regulations, and security regulations. This includes obtaining necessary approvals, permits, and certifications.
