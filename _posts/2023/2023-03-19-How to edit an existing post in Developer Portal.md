### Overview
This post provides step-by-step guidance on how to update an existing content in Developer Portal using the inline editor. 

### Step 1
In the header of each post, you'll see there are two ways to update a post.  

If you want to edit the post directly in the GitHub repository, click on the link 'GitHub edit'. You will be redirected to the corresponding file in GitHub repository. The detailed steps for this are available [here](https://developer.qed.qld.gov.au/getting-started/How-to-edit-a-post-using-GitHub-repository/).

But if you want to edit the post without leaving the portal, read on!

### Step 2
* To edit the post using the inline editor, click on the link 'Edit'. You will be redirected to the 'Edit Post' page, where you can edit the post. 
* If you need a primer on how to use Markdown, this [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) can help.
* Tick the checkbox to indicate that the content does not contain any protected information and that it abides by the copyright laws. You can then click on the 'Update' button to submit the updated content.

### Step 3
All changes require review by a moderator but, assuming a moderator approves the updated contact, your changes will be published. 

If you don't see your changes after about a week, you can 'poke' the moderator via your profile summary. Just find the title of the post in your profile summary and click the question mark.
