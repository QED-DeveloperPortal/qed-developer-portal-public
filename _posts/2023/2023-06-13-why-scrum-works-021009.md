### Introduction
Scrum isn’t just a process — it’s a way for teams to work smarter, deliver faster, and collaborate better. At its heart are a set of values and principles that guide how teams operate and succeed. Here’s a quick guide to what makes Scrum tick.  


### Scrum values
- **Commitment:** Everyone on the team — product owner, scrum master, and developers—owns the sprint goals and gives their best effort.  
- **Focus:** Prioritize what matters most and stay aligned with the sprint goal. Minimize distractions to deliver value consistently.  
- **Openness:** Share ideas, feedback, and concerns freely. A transparent environment encourages trust, learning and improvement.  
- **Respect:** Appreciate each person’s skills and contributions. Respect builds a positive and productive team culture.  
- **Courage:** Take risks, try new ideas, and speak up when something isn’t right. Mistakes become opportunities to learn.

### Scrum principles
- **Empirical process control:** Inspect, adapt, and respond to change. Scrum teams rely on experience and feedback to improve.  
- **Self-organization:** Teams decide how to get the work done. This encourages ownership, accountability, creativity, and better outcomes.  
- **Collaboration:** Work closely with stakeholders to ensure the team delivers what’s truly needed. Communication is the key.  
- **Time-boxing:** Events like daily scrums, sprint planning, and reviews have set time limits. This keeps work focused and disciplined.  
- **Iterative & incremental delivery:** Deliver small, testable pieces of the product each sprint. Early feedback reduces risk and allows faster adaptation.  


### Why Scrum Works
Scrum thrives when teams live its values and principles. By embracing **commitment, focus, openness, respect, and courage**, and following **collaboration, self-organization, and iterative delivery**, teams can deliver better products, faster, and with real impact.
