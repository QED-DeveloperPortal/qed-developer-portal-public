### Overview

This post provides step-by-step guidance on how to update an existing post in the Developer Portal using the GitHub repository.

### Step 1
In the header of each post, you'll see there are two ways to update it. 

If you want to edit the post using the inline editing tool, click on the link 'Edit'. The detailed steps for this are available [here](/public/How-to-edit-an-existing-post-in-Developer-Portal/).

If you want to edit the post using the GitHub repository, click on the link 'GitHub edit'.

### Step 3

Once you have made changes to the post content, you need to submit the changes. At the bottom of the page, there is a section to commit the changes. You need to add your comment , select the radio button to create a patch branch and click on 'Propose changes' button.

You will be redirected to another page to open a pull request. You need to select the reviewers and assignees from the right-hand side of the page. Then, you can click on the 'Create pull request' button.

### Step 5

You can enable 'Auto-merge' so that the build will be triggered once the pull request has been approved.

### Step 6

All changes require review by a moderator but, assuming a moderator approves the updated contact, your changes will be published. 

If you don't see your changes after about a week, you can 'poke' the moderator via your profile summary. Just find the title of the post in your profile summary and click the question mark.
