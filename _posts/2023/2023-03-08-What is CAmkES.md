**Cambridge (Cambridge) / Composition (Multiple Applications) / Kernel (Kernel) / Embedding (Embedded) / System (System) (CAmkES)** is a component-based development platform for building embedded systems. It was developed by researchers at the University of New South Wales, NICTA (National ICT Australia), and the University of Cambridge.

**CAmkES** is designed to help developers build complex embedded systems that require high levels of safety, security, and reliability. It is based on the idea of composing individual components together to form a complete system. Each component is a self-contained module that performs a specific function, and can be developed and tested independently of the rest of the system. The components are then integrated into a larger system using a set of formal composition rules.

**CAmkES** provides a number of benefits for embedded systems development, including increased modularity, better separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and the ability to reuse components across different projects. It also provides a high degree of assurance, since the formal composition rules ensure that the resulting system is correct by construction.

Overall, **CAmkES** is a powerful tool for building complex embedded systems that require high levels of safety, security, and reliability.
